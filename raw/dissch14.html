<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >In the last chapter of this thesis, I would like to present some ideas for future research in persuasive
password support. Although I would have loved to start working on these already now, they go
beyond the scope of this thesis and should be left to future work. As final remarks, I want to share
my views on current developments of password authentication, where I see it in the near future, and
how its future can be shaped more positively.
</p>
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1    </span> <a 
 id="x129-40500014.1"></a>Ideas for Future Work</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >The recommendations in Section <a 
href="dissch13.html#x126-39700013.1">13.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:summary:recommendations --></a> touched on future work on a high level. However, one
recommendation was to follow up on ideas off the beaten path. Addressing this criterion,
the following sections provide more specific ideas to work on password support in the
future.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x129-40600014.1.1"></a>Follow-Up Studies</h4>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >First and foremost, it will be worthwhile to address the limitations of the studies we conducted, or
follow up on the leads from initial results. For instance, the PASDJO deployment in the wild
suffered from lack of demographic data to understand individual differences in password
perception. The second study on personality lacked more randomness of the available passwords
and it would thus be a straightforward solution to integrate a short, optional psychometric
questionnaire into PASDJO. Alternatively, we could have crowd-workers fill out a more elaborate
psychometric survey before they play PASDJO and then fit regression models on the data. In any
case, by combining the two approaches we will overcome current limitations of the two studies at
once.
</p><!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, it will be vital to evaluate the Password Reuse Manager (PWRM, see Chapter <a 
href="dissch12.html#x122-37000012">12<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:perdespassup --></a>)
with a longitudinal study. At this point, we used a rapid iterative design method that was focused on
qualitative feedback on features. The next step will be to invite a larger audience to test it for at
least one month. To boost usage numbers during the field trial, the browser extension can be made
compatible with additional browsers with very little effort. It is already built on the WebExtensions
API, which is increasingly solid on all major browsers. We had also identified specific research
questions that can be answered with A/B testing. One of the issues was that users kept their
previous password managers activated and the additional extension simply generated more effort.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
The follow-up study should therefore screen for participants who do not use a password
manager yet (group A), and another group who will be required to move over to the PWRM
as single management solution throughout the entire study (group B). To extend the
method space (see recommendation <a 
href="dissch13.html#x126-3970065">5<!--tex4ht:ref: recommendation:method_space --></a> in Section <a 
href="dissch13.html#x126-39700013.1">13.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:summary:recommendations --></a>) and better understand how the
support works for the users, the study should conclude with the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">break up-/love-letter</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">method</span><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss130.html#fn1x53"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x129-406001f1"></a>.
Here, participants decide whether to write a love or a break-up letter to the PWRM, which will
allow us to understand the emotional component of password support.
</p><!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >Finally, some of our other studies involved a password <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">creation </span>task (see Chapters <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>,<a 
href="dissch10.html#x106-30600010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:decoy --></a>, and <a 
href="dissch11.html#x110-33200011">11<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:emojipasswords --></a>).
Although we followed guidelines to establish realistic scenarios, it would have been desirable to
study password selection in-situ. Thus, in the future, we should leverage existing web-applications
to test concepts when they are mature enough. Establishing collaborations with industry partners is
critical to carry out this research approach.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x129-40700014.1.2"></a>Personalizing Password Policies</h4>
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Personalization is a current big trend in user experience design and persuasive
technology<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss131.html#fn2x53"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x129-407001f2"></a>,
especially since the breakthrough in machine-learning capabilities. It was already an element in the
Persuasive Authentication Framework <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. We have found that personality has a notable
influence on how users perceive password policies (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>). Therefore, it is conceivable to
leverage state-of-the-art computing power to tailor password requirements to individual users
instead of relying on a one-fits-all approach. Hypothetically, if the system could detect what policy
will <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">help </span>the user in finding the best trade-off between password strength and usability, its
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
user experience of would not be degraded by password authentication (as it is now). I
provided initial pointers about the benefits in a position paper adjunct to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">PERSUASIVE’17</span>
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSeitz2017PersonalizingPasswordPolicies">287</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Tackling this challenge is possible with several focus areas, where the P4P framework can guide
design decisions. For instance, we could advance algorithms to detect re-used passwords more
reliably at registration. Khern-am-nuai et al. have showed an initial proof-of-concept that
keystroke dynamics provide useful features <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKhern-am-nuai2017Journal">193</a>]</span>, but they performed all analyses post-hoc.
Machine-learning can potentially enable reuse detection already at enrollment and allow us to tailor
feedback more appropriately. For instance, we can design a solution that makes alternatives to
password reuse more salient, in case reuse practices become too risky (the process is
depicted in Figure <a 
href="#x129-407002r1">14.1<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:summary:flow-chart --></a>). Similar approaches are conceivable with different personality
profiles. However, here it is much more likely to tailor personalize support strategies during
password <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">reset</span>, because the service potentially possesses more data about the user at that
point.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.3    </span> <a 
 id="x129-40800014.1.3"></a>Contextualizing Password Feedback</h4>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Beyond personalization, which can be described as context-sensitive adaptation to the user, we
should also consider tailoring password feedback to the system’s context. For instance, we can
create themed password meters to avoid habituation effects <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HelpingUsersCreateBetterPasswords">344</a>]</span>. Kroeze and Olivier proposed
using an evolving Pokemon as metaphor for the “evolution state” of the password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication">204</a>]</span>. This kind
of meter should probably be deployed on a game-related service, or directly for the registration
page of Pokemon Go. As part of a design study, I created a themed password meter that matches
the deployment context: Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> shows a password meter that was originally created for a
music-festival app. It is based on the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">share-explain-help </span>paradigm and is only one of many design
options for this context. For instance, we could also choose a personalized social nudge and
say “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">only Justin Bieber fans use passwords like that</span>” – this could trigger in-/out-group
biases and motivate some users to act differently. Ideally, such feedback systems are
evaluated in situ, but to make it easier, we can use a cover story first, e.g. by creating a
mock-website and recruit participants for usability tests thereof. Moreover, to assess the
advantages of contextualized feedback, there should be a control group with neutral
feedback.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.4    </span> <a 
 id="x129-40900014.1.4"></a>Solving Password Breach Aftermath</h4>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Database breaches containing passwords occur frequently with different levels of severity
depending on security standards at the affected service. Users face an immediate risk, but might be
unaware of the situation, so they do not take swift measures to protect their account. To mitigate
this, service providers invalidate affected user accounts after they have detected a breach. This
action is necessary to reestablish a secure overall system state where attackers cannot
impersonate users on the platform. Usually, service providers inform users upon this
countermeasure and prompt them to reset their passwords via email campaigns <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuh2017TooBusy">169</a>]</span>. While these
countermeasures are unavoidable, they fall short of addressing the domino effect of reused
passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XIves2004DominoEffectReuse">173</a>]</span>. Many users do not understand the ramifications of a password breach and
might only reset the password on the affected site. All other sites that share the same
credentials remain at risk. I propose that service providers constantly monitor password leaks
both on their own and on third party websites. In other words, while they might use a
blacklist during account creation, there is usually no check-up mechanism that takes
the updated risk-level into account. During this routine check-up, accounts that share
credentials with affected third parties can be invalidated. The implementation should be
straightforward with the aid of breach data freely available from different sources, e.g.
<a 
href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords</span></a>. However, there are a few issues that we need to
solve in the future. First, freely available password lists rarely contain user-names to avoid targeted
attacks. Second, if accounts are invalidated because a check-up has found a breached set of
credentials, users might misunderstand the reasons for the account lock-down. Phishing attacks
often exploit “your account was locked down for security reasons” as a hook to obtain users’
real credentials. Sending out emails with reset prompts is thus especially dangerous
because they may raise suspicion, and it is hard for novice users to verify if the prompt is
legitimate.
</p><!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Finally, it would be interesting to study how user behavior changes after a breach. So far, there have
been attempts to collect initial data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuh2017TooBusy">169</a>]</span>, but there is far more that we have not measured, yet. For
instance, it will be interesting to find out if personality traits are associated with user behavior
after a breach. While it would be fair to assume that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">conscientious </span>users change their
passwords more quickly and consistently, we did not necessarily observe such expected
behavior in our own studies. Thus, there might be many opportunities for surprising
insights.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">14.1.5    </span> <a 
 id="x129-41000014.1.5"></a>Re-locating Password Feedback</h4>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >A final problem to address in future work is the fact that many users simply do not <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">notice </span>password
feedback and therefore cannot re-assess their choice. Many users look down on their hands when
typing passwords on regular hardware keyboards, because they have not mastered touch typing.
During password entry, on-screen feedback is then out of sight. This could explain why password
meters have smaller impact on password selection in the wild: while study participants might
take care to follow all on-screen instructions in an online experiment, users are often
less focused on the screen in real-world tasks. Therefore, we should study the impact
of password feedback if it is relocated closer to the hands. The Touch Bar of current
generations of the Apple MacBook Pro models is a visual output close to the hardware keys. It
could be leveraged as display for both visual and textual password strength feedback.
To the best of my knowledge, this has not been investigated, but might be a feasible
solution.

<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >I believe that users are not the weakest link in the authentication chain. There are always
security mitigations on the system side that can take responsibility away from users.
For instance, if all services had infinite resources to invest into penetration tests and
alike, the need for exceptionally strong passwords vanishes. And although some user
behavior is arguably risky, people should not be blamed for faulty systems that permit risks.
Commentaries on the web and other media do the rest when they name and shame users
for weak password behavior (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). Perhaps, their intentions are good, but
the subtext is different: Plenty of users are doing the same, so why would any one user
act differently than the rest? This is maladroit framing of normative messages at best
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCialdini2003CraftingNormativeMessages">56</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 124--><p class="noindent" >Passwords annoy users for a good reason. Most of us will not grief, if passwords become obsolete
tomorrow. Probably, in the future, we will be able to make machines intelligent enough to
independently decide whether a user should be granted access or not, all without explicit
authentication. PCs and mobiles will automatically lock when the user is not in the vicinity. Natural
interactions will enable us to tell virtual assistants to temporarily grant access to devices,
e.g. by saying <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“Alexa, my daughter can use my iPad while we are driving to Italy, but</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">make sure that she can only browse safe websites”</span>, all without the hassle of sharing
PINs or enrolling biometric features. Naturally, a few drawbacks will remain, because
perfect security cannot be guaranteed, and this will raise trust issues. People want to
stay in charge and although passwords appear to be an inferior technology, they can
achieve a higher level of perceived control. Thus, there will not only be a need but also
a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">demand </span>for knowledge-based authentication in the future. Drawing on an analogy,
passwords are perhaps the vinyl records in a world of ubiquitous music streaming: They
are a bit clunky, impractical, and can be damaged through careless handling. On the
other hand, experts still recommend them despite being an obsolete technology. People
treasure them for years, often become collectors and try to find the rare, unique gems of
long-lost quality. Once attacks on password alternatives like multimodal biometrics become
