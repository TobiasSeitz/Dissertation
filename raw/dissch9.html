<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >The overall goal of this thesis is to support users in how they interact with passwords. As a
sub-goal, we wanted to help those users who want to handle password management on their own,
i.e. without a password manager. We set out to achieve this goal by studying the design space of
password feedback mechanisms like password meters, i.e., the various dimensions, choices and
outcomes of a design challenge. There have been many proposals and numerous evaluations
already for such feedback systems. However, the design space appears rather narrow if we only
look at existing solutions, and many have not supported users well enough. Therefore, we posit that
the design space needs to be opened up in more breadth. To get there, studying the requirements of
password feedback is a necessary first step. Previous solutions have seldom reported a structured
requirement elicitation based on user research. Thus, before designing and implementing support
strategies outside of the usual spectrum, we first aimed to understand the needs and
expectations that users may have about password feedback. We tried to learn from feature
requests and co-designed proposals as a starting point for generating novel ideas about
actionable password feedback. In particular, we posed the following broad research
questions:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">What do users <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">expect </span>from password support tools during account creation (explicit)
      and what do they really <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">need </span>(implicit)?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">How can we design password feedback in novel ways outside the usual spectrum of
      visual password meters and verbal real-time feedback?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">How can we leverage the interplay between feed-<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">forward </span>and feedback?</li></ul>
<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >This chapter reports on a requirements- and design-exploration for password feedback, where we
wanted to involve users early in the process. The project was a collaboration between myself and
Caroline Olsienkiewicz, respectively Katharina Schwarz, who wrote their bachelor theses on
specific aspects of the exploration <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >The design space of persuasive interventions in authentication was put into a framework by Forget
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. They established high-level strategies to steer users away from risky actions.
However, while their <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">Persuasive Authentication Framework</a> described how hypothetical
design solutions could be categorized, it did not tell us much about the specific user
needs in feedback systems. The same goes for more generic persuasive models like
Cialdini’s “six weapons” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCialdini2007Influence">57</a>]</span>, or Fogg’s Behavior Model <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFogg2009BehavioralModel">119</a>]</span>. The latter provides hints
to user requirements in system design, but those are not specific enough for password
authentication.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >On the other hand, there exists a wide range of designs for persuasive password support that have
been empirically evaluated, too. For instance, Ur et al. studied feedback with numerous solutions
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HelpingUsersCreateBetterPasswords">344</a>]</span>. Egelman et al. also explored novel designs for password meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>. Moreover,
Shay et al. continued Forget’s exploration of real-time feedback and suggestions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>]</span>.
Beyond real time feedback and meters, Komanduri et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2014Telepathwords">199</a>]</span> and Yee <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYee2006Passpet">384</a>]</span> showed an approach
to make predictability of passwords graspable. All these publications report on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">solutions </span>and
corresponding usability evaluations, but they often do not talk about the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">needs </span>that users have
regarding the support.
</p><!--l. 52--><p class="noindent" >Thus, our project focused on eliciting these needs and provide a holistic view on password
feedback and support systems. Ultimately, understanding the needs might help us broaden the
design space further and find more effective and actionable password support. To get there, we
chose a “put the user first” lens and conducted two studies that focused on different levels of user
needs (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). In the first study (Section <a 
href="#x103-2750009.2">9.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:codesign:part1 --></a>) we wanted to learn explicit and observable
needs, i.e. the things that users <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">say </span>they need or that can be understood by <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">observing </span>how they
interact with a solution. The second study (Section <a 
href="#x103-2880009.3">9.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:codesign:part2 --></a>) was more involved with tacit and
latent needs. These are hard to observe and require more engagement with users, to
understand what they actually know and feel when they interact with a password support
system.

<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >After the literature review (see Part <a 
href="disspa1.html#x7-45000I">I<!--tex4ht:ref: part:related_work --></a>), there were still open questions about user <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">expectations</span>
regarding password strength feedback. Most studies went ahead to test new solutions quantitatively
and rarely focused on the intrinsic needs to derive requirements for feedback. In other words, users
were often involved late in the design process, although an earlier involvement could have led to
different design decisions. Our goal in the first step of the co-designing process was gathering early
insights to learn about the requirements of persuasive interventions in the realm of password
authentication. To narrow down the focus of the requirements, it was important to consider a
realistic use-case where the burden of password authentication is relatively high. From related
work, we know that password changes are more frequent in work environments, because
expiration-policies are still common there <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>. Frequent password changes lead to
weaker practices, which might be mitigated by effective password feedback. To find
out how we might improve such feedback, we used a lightweight, rapid survey with a
large portion of open questions. In the following, we briefly describe the method and
findings.

<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >We opted for an online survey to inform our requirement elicitation for the above described reasons
and straightforward data collection. Our questionnaire was centered around the following core
research questions: </p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">What do users <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">expect </span>from password feedback?

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x103-2770009.2.1"></a>Prototype</h5>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >To ensure that participants have a shared understanding of password feedback mechanisms, we
created a small website featuring only a password field and textual feedback beneath. The
underlying strength estimation and feedback phrases were based on the zxcvbn library. Warnings
and suggestions that come with zxcvbn were translated to German and shown as the users typed
inside the password field. The 26 warnings included statements like “Names and surnames by
themselves are easy to guess” or “Avoid repeated words and characters”. We tried to simplify the
page as much as possible to minimize priming effects, although this was hard to achieve. In
particular, we did not show any form of visual feedback to explore whether this is a need that
participants mentioned often. Instead, we showed a password score in the form “strength:
2/5”. The page introduced the scenario (old password at work has expired) and asked
participants to create a new password that would fulfill the composition policy of the
participant’s current employer. The composition policy, however, was not enforced,
but we probed it in the questionnaire. We did not log the passwords whatsoever, since
this was not the focus of this study. This was disclosed to participants, and they could
decide to drop out of the study if they were still uncomfortable with providing a new
password.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x103-2780009.2.1"></a>Questionnaire</h5>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >The survey questionnaire included 37 questions, many of which are quick single- and
multiple-selection items to collect context information (e.g. demographics, semantic differentials,
social desirability scale). This information would help us assess the value and relative importance
of qualitative statements that followed. The core of the questionnaire is formed by eleven items
about password feedback, six of which were open questions, e.g. what would need to be
changed to make the feedback more comprehensible and how password creation could
be facilitated. Moreover, we inquired coping strategies at work and personal password
behaviors to derive further requirements. During this part of the questionnaire, we added an
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">instructional manipulation check</span>, i.e. an attention check, to filter out participants that were only
trying to complete the survey as fast as possible to receive the incentive <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOppenheimer2009InstructionalManipulationChecks">249</a>]</span>. This is a
well-known issue with crowd-sourced survey data, and the attention checks can effectively
reduce the risk of low-quality data. The items were randomized where necessary, but
the overall structure was the same for all participants, i.e. there were no independent
variables.

 id="x103-279001f1"></a>
which provided similar crowd-sourcing features as Amazon’s Mechanical Turk but has a
stronger focus on research surveys. Since <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a> does not allow German users to sign up,
Prolific is one of the best alternatives because of its large user panel. We screened for
German language proficiency via Prolific’s internal screening tool. The survey also required
participants to be employed and using alphanumeric passwords in their work environment on a
regular basis. From the 87 users who started the survey, we had to eliminate 47 responses
based on previously defined exclusion criteria: incomplete or mechanically translated;
incomprehensible answers; failure to complete the instructional manipulation check <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOppenheimer2009InstructionalManipulationChecks">249</a>]</span>; and
fourth-quartile scores on the social desirability scale. The remaining 40 respondents had a
diverse educational and professional background, but the largest part (n=15, 37.5%) held
positions in IT or online media. Sixteen were female (40%) and 24 male (60%). They
were aged between 20 and 53 (<span

inspired by Grounded Theory and useful for exploring sentiment and mental models early in the
design process <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStrauss1990">321</a>]</span>. It consisted of three distinct parts: open coding, axial coding and a final
selective coding stage. In the first stage, the data is labeled with an unlimited number of fitting
codes. Next, the codes are grouped and abstracted. A second coder independently put the codes into
the groups. Differences were discussed until a common solution was found. Finally, the number of
code-groups are reduced to the essential themes that best describe the thinking processes, or as in
our case, the requirements.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x103-2810009.2.2"></a>Overall Results and Central Themes</h4>
<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Overall participants were positive about receiving support during password selection, often because
“any kind of help is good help”. Some stated they were convinced that feedback is helpful to create
stronger passwords. The primary benefits they mentioned were reduced frustration and
simplification, because it gives reassurance. The latter is a direct lead to the Persuasive
Authentication Framework <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. If participants were negative about password feedback (n=4),
their primary qualm was that they were convinced to achieve strong passwords without external
help. In the following, we present the central themes in participants’ statements. Multiple coding
stages, discussions, and the selection tasks helped us identify overarching needs: <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Show</span>, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Explain</span>,
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Help</span>, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Empower</span>. To keep the narrative coherent, we omit all corollary results that did not guide
further research steps. These are reported in higher detail in C. Olsienkiewicz’ thesis
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlsienkiewicz2016BAThesis">248</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 49--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x103-2820009.2.2"></a>Show</h5>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >“Show” appears to be the most important category because at least one answer from each
participant could be put into this code. Unsurprisingly, participants preferred <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">visual feedback </span>over
verbal feedback. Our prototype refrained from graphical elements entirely, but participants wanted
a visual representation of strength. Most notably, a “horizontal bar” was mentioned, i.e. a simple
password meter. Some participants felt that verbal strength categories are patronizing. “Colors” and
“steps” were commonly mentioned. This theme echoes Ur et al.’s quantitative findings
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >At the same time, the “Show” theme encompasses that participants would like the password reset
form to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">show </span>what it expects from the user. If digits or symbols are expected, the feedback
should <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">show </span>their impact on the users’ security or show the risks that are taken by not
including symbols and digits. P4 mentioned that if old passwords are disallowed, then
these passwords should be shown when creating a new one to know what is going to be
forbidden. Hence, “show” does not only include feed<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">back</span>, but also feed<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">forward </span>to align
expectations. Therefore, compliance is a mutual contract, and the theme again highlights Sasse
and Flechais’ argumentation that authentication schemes are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">socio-technical systems</span>
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x103-2830009.2.2"></a>Explain</h5>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >When asked what advice they would have expected from the feedback, answers clearly indicated
that participants had a fixed notion of what makes a strong password. Verbal feedback, in their
view, should point out that digits, symbols, uppercase letters, randomness, and password length are
beneficial for password strength. Most of this is in line with findings from previous chapters and
related work. It is interesting, though, that this consensus also shows us that the feedback would not
be necessary at all. Responses from participants who unexpectedly received a low strength rating
and feedback highlighted an important aspect: If feedback stands in <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">stark contrast </span>to how the user
perceives their password’s strength, explanations are both welcome and necessary: “Why is the
password rated only with two out of five stars?” (P7) – “How precisely is the strength
and feedback determined?” (P34,P28). The desire to understand the rating is hence the
key to correct mental models, but needs to be cued by lower-than-anticipated strength
ratings. Potentially, past study results pointed towards the inefficacy of password meters,
because they were not accompanied by explanations in case the rating contradicted user
beliefs.
</p><!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >The theme sometimes overlaps with “show”, because once a feedback system <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">shows </span>the risks,
participants suggested <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">explaining </span>them in detail, i.e. explain the consequences of weak
passwords. At the same time, a good comprehensible explanation was mentioned to
convey the notion that service providers “know what they are talking about” (P1). Thus,
nuanced “explanation-design” is essential for those users eager to learn more. Realistically,
though, experience tells us that not many people actively seek explanations, but our
analysis hints at opportunities to explain the details when strength feedback breaks mental
models.
</p><!--l. 96--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x103-2840009.2.2"></a>Help</h5>
<!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >The “Help” theme informs design decisions around <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">suggestions</span>. Eleven participants noted that
specific guidance towards a stronger or memorable password might help them. The well-known
repertoire of tips, examples, “formulas” (P4), generators, mnemonics, etc. was the center of
attention. Showing users <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">examples </span>was mentioned by two participants to help them understand
what makes a “perfect” password and is therefore an overlap with the “Show” theme. Another two
participants had the idea to show “best practices” from other users of the service. At the same time,
one participant was skeptical about the use of help, because the outcome might be too
predictable: “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">The feedback is helpful, but [if everybody takes the advice,] won’t that mean</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">that all passwords become too similar?” </span>(P12). In some way, she was right, because
example-passwords can persuade users to mimick the given example and become more vulnerable
than before, so the design should respect this concern. One participant hinted at solving this
problem by suggesting modifications based on the currently entered password, or give

users towards stronger passwords, which was later studied intensively by Shay et al.

<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" >The three aforementioned themes flow into the final one: <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">empowering </span>users to be creative, put
suggestions into practice, and to be confident in their choice. Most notably, the concept of
restricting characters and limiting password strength was a primary concern. Although we initially
would not have considered composition policies as “feedback”, the participants made a fair point:
rejecting a password due to a composition policy is a feedback mechanism. However, rejection can
easily be perceived as destructive feedback, which manifested in the mentioned negative
experiences. Instead, combining “Show”, “Explain”, and “Help” can become a full-fledged
creativity support tool: Show what can be improved, explain why, and help by demonstrating
alternative ways.

<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >The insights should be implemented with the study’s limitations in mind. Overall, the themes we
found are a small snapshot of user needs and need further consolidation for production-level
solutions.
</p><!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >First, we were surprised that so many English-speaking users from the Prolific panel were able to
make it through the platform’s screening process. Therefore, we had to discard many responses
where we were unsure about the participant’s language skills. Ideally, we should have
introduced a small passage of prose to which the participants answers 2-3 comprehension
questions. However, we failed to anticipate this until the data was in and also did not plan the
budget for the study accordingly. For the remaining participants, however, we ensured the
qualitative responses were solid. Also, it would have been feasible to be able to ask follow up
questions, which was a caveat of the online study method. The sample we would have been
able to recruit for in-person interviews, however, would not have been diverse enough,
so we were limited in the choice of methods. The number of open questions and the
resulting answers were still sufficient to perform in-depth analyses and led to interesting
findings.

<!--l. 139--><p class="noindent" >With an online survey, we explored what users explicitly expect from password support. The most
important take-away was that support is especially important and potentially most effective when
feedback contradicts users’ mental models about their own password practices. We were able to
derive a new perspective on password support. We will call it the <span

paradigm in the remainder of this thesis.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >As second step of the co-creation project, we aimed to learn from specific user-generated designs
and solutions. Therefore, we took to the participatory design methodology. In its essence, it is a
technique that constitutes a “shift in attitude from designing <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">for </span>users to one of designing <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">with</span>
users” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSanders2002ParticipatoryDesign">16</a>]</span>. Therefore, having identified a research question, users from the targeted segment are
involved from the beginning in design explorations and create their own solutions (“Make” in
Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). Moreover, a tight feedback loop makes sure that all designs are created under a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">shared</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">ownership</span>. In our case, we were eager to find out what a novel password support system
could look like. In particular, unusual and exciting ideas beyond simple password meters
were the center of attention. The overarching goal was to identify <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">what users require</span>
from password feedback systems, which would help us design them in more persuasive
ways.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.3.1    </span> <a

<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >We used the participatory design approach to learn new requirements for persuasive feedback. The
methodology included a co-design session with various exercises, an exploration and refinement of
the initial ideas, a feedback loop on the progress of the concepts, and the creation of a final

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >The 60-minute co-design session started with a briefing about the goals and informed consent to
record the session on video. Afterwards, we sensitized participants for the topic with two
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">ball-bearing exercises</span>. For this, participants were divided into two groups and those faced each
other in a circle. Each person interviewed another on a specific question of password behavior for
one minute. The outer circle moved to the next interviewer until they had talked to all people from
the inner circle. In the first round, interviewers were given questions on personal password
selection and coping strategies. The second round focused on recommendations to different user
groups. The interviewers then summarized their insights and shared them with the group. The
exercise was helpful to learn other people’s password strategies and broaden the participants’
horizon. They said it was interesting to reflect about obstacles in acting more securely. In
summary, participants showed typical selection strategies based on word-digit-symbol
patterns and would recommend personal, memorable events as starting points for password
selection.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >What followed were straightforward brainstorming exercises in two groups. The question they tried
to answer was “How would a registration form of an email provider need to be designed to help
you create a secure password?” The facilitator encouraged participants to think out of
the box and contribute unusual ideas. After five minutes, half of each group moved to
the other group. In total, participants produced 17 distinct ideas and presented them on
a whiteboard. Everyone received two votes for their favorite ideas. Participants then
formed groups of two or three to create paper prototypes for the three ideas that had the
most votes. The facilitator made sure to explain the process and the expected fidelity of
the outcome. Once the prototypes were ready, the groups presented them to the entire
crowd.

were female. Three were studying philology, while one each were studying pedagogy, media
informatics and business studies. The only male participant was an employed product

<!--l. 35--><p class="noindent" >Based on the participants’ paper prototypes, we designed ten variations of each idea, i.e. 30 concept

Afterwards, we discussed the feasibility of each solution and identified six candidates that were
presented to the study participants. Their feedback informed the decision on the final prototype.
After it was implemented with standard web-technologies, participants provided a final round of
qualitative feedback and a reflection on the process. Participation thus occurred in each step of the
design process.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x103-2930009.3.2"></a>Concepts and Prototype</h4>
<!--l. 39--><p class="noindent" >The paper prototypes of the brainstorming session showed three central components: <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">rewards</span>,
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">analogies and compliance</span>, and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">playfulness</span>. After the 10 plus 10 method, we had six candidates
that made it to the final feedback round, two of each category. Please note that we tried to stay as
close to the participants’ original ideas as possible and maintained concepts that were
unrealistic.
</p>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x103-2940009.3.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Rewards</span></span>
The “beautify” concept removed all color from the website and faded it back in as the entered
password increases in strength. The “friends” concept would provide a password meter that uses
pictures of the user’s friends instead of color to reward stronger passwords and add a personal
touch.
</p>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x103-2950009.3.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Analogies and Compliance</span></span>
Concepts in this category tried to nudge users by making strength more graspable and salient. The
“songs” concept shows the number of songs that one can listen to until an attacker would have
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
cracked the password. The “fruits” concept (see Figure <a 
href="#x103-296001r1">9.2a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:co-design:fruitsalad --></a>) draws from a healthy-eating analogy
and represents each character type with a fruit. While the user types, fruits are “plucked” from a
character patch and moved to the password field. If a password only contains lowercase letters, the
lack of complexity is immediately visible because only one type of fruit would have been
plucked.
</p>
<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x103-2960009.3.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Playfulness</span></span>
The “slotmachine” idea lets the user first enter a password. Then they pull the lever of a virtual
slotmachine. When it stops, it displays four random characters that would make the password
stronger. The user can then claim the win by adding the random characters to their password.
Finally, the “bubbles” concept lets the user burst bubbles floating on the screen (see Figure <a 
href="#x103-296002r2">9.2b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:co-design:bubbles-concept --></a>).
Inside each bubble, there is either a letter, digit, or symbol. The user can click on them directly to
transfer the corresponding character to the password field, or burst bubbles by typing on the
keyboard. The longer the password, the fewer bubbles remain. Also, less common character
classes are shown in bigger bubbles to persuade users to burst those and hereby increase
complexity.

<!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Participants provided feedback on the six concepts and generally considered the “bubbles” concept
the best solution to motivate themselves to add more symbols or digits and also make the password
longer to watch more bubbles burst. Therefore, we implemented it as an HTML5-based prototype.
To add a more game-like feel, we put a score on each character class, and show the currently
achieved total score in the GUI. The bubbles move slowly enough to trace them and their
bursts.
</p><!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >Five of the participants provided a final round of feedback. On the positive side, they felt it
intriguing to burst the bubbles. They understood the purpose of the bubbles and the different sizes
and colors right away or after typing the first character. Two participants noted that it fosters
creativity. All said that a system like this would catch their eye and might impact their selection
behavior. They also mentioned a number of improvements. For instance, two participants fount the
page chaotic and wanted it simplified. The scoring was not transparent either, and three said the
bursting animation should be more obtrusive.

helped us understand various user needs. We heard that the group had not given the topic much
thought before joining the brainstorming session. Many of their ideas went beyond typical
password meters, which we highly encouraged. In particular, the concepts show a tendency to
<span

to the <span

class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">help </span>theme was visible especially in the
compliance-centered concepts: The “fruit-salad” supports people in recognizing a potential lack of
character diversity. While the “songs” analogy is a kind of <span

because it gives background information, the ideas did not contain many attempts to explain
additional aspects. Perhaps, participants equated strength with complexity – a mental model that we
found in Chapter <a

Password meters and real-time feedback are the de facto paragon of persuasion in the wild. Most
commonly, they fulfill requirements (1), (2), (4), and (5). For instance, Google’s password meter
visually encodes password strength with color and bar-size, suggests not using a pet’s name, offers
extensive background information with a clear call-to-action, and does not jeopardize
trustworthiness with extravagant design. On the other hand, it does not necessarily empower users
to break habits, is not personalized (what if the user does not have a pet?), and does not
account for other “obvious” strategies. Academia has produced alternative designs that
fulfill requirements (7), (8), and (9), although unusual concepts (like in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>]</span>) were
rarely adopted in practice. Empowerment, personalization, and breaking habituation
effects have been underexplored, and thus might be worthwhile opportunities for future
studies.

 id="x103-3030009.4.2"></a>Relation to Current Frameworks</h4>
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >Most of the themes and requirements show strong links to various persuasion frameworks. In the
first study, the qualitative analysis resulted in four essential themes: show, explain, help, empower.
Interestingly, there are parallels to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">teaching</span>. Teachers <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">show </span>something new, and then <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">explain </span>it
in more detail. They <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">help </span>students understand it. Often students can then exercise and
explore ways to apply their knowledge, i.e. the process <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">empowers </span>students to achieve
something they could not do before. Forget et al., who contributed one of the early works on
persuasion in cybersecurity, promoted their <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">Persuasive Authentication Framework</a> as a tool
to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">educate </span>users. All the elements of our qualitative analysis are thus visible in their
framework. The requirements in Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> represent the themes on a more fine-grained
level. Only requirements (8) and (10) are hard to put into the PAF, hence they extend the
framework. Requirement (8) states that a password support tool should be noticeable
and foster curiosity. Generating curiosity can be done in numerous ways, but in this
context it relates to Cialdini’s <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">scarcity </span>principle. The number of “good” passwords is
much smaller than the number of “bad” ones, hence they are a scarce resource. The
requirement states that users should realize this and become motivated to access the limited
resource.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.5    </span> <a 
 id="x103-3040009.5"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >Our goal was to understand the requirements of persuasive password support, especially user needs
and expectations. We triangulated methods to rapidly derive feasible requirements that guide future
designs of interventions. The survey yielded explicit and idealistic needs, like having one’s own
mental model confirmed by the feedback system. On the other hand, the participatory approach of
the second study helped us identify latent needs that would not be detectable in a survey. The
results, however, fit together well and solidify the overarching themes “show”, “explain”,
“help”, and “empower”. Here, we found that participants’ expectations of password
feedback were nuanced and can thus only be met by combining both verbal and visual
support. Feedback was not the only component, because participants showed a need for
more guidance in the form of feed<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">forward</span>. The requirements might have been partially
predictable even without conducting user research, but tacit and latent needs are uncommonly
discussed in related research. Especially the thinking processes and participants’ design
approaches in the participatory sessions revealed much of what they envisioned in a successful
intervention. Applying the requirements to gauge existing solutions, we identified opportunities
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
for future work in personalization, empowerment, and preventing habituation effects
from repeated exposure to the same intervention. These are addressed in the following
chapters.
