<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Our previous efforts to support users focused on suggestions, feedback, and feed-forward to help
users create stronger passwords. We now continue to explore a different dimension of
persuasive design that was supposed to make it easier for users to create both strong and
highly memorable passwords. To that end, we looked at <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">emojis </span>as possible solution, since
we have found positive attitudes towards using them inside passwords (see Chapter
<a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>). Emojis are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">pictographs </span>used to express emotions or communicate words with
pictures. The Unicode consortium has made them part of the de-facto digital encoding
standard<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss111.html#fn1x44"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x110-332001f1"></a>,
which led to widespread adoption very quickly. In 2015, the “face with
tears of joy” emoji (Xygp) became the Oxford dictionary’s <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">word of the</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">year</span><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss112.html#fn2x44"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x110-332002f2"></a>,
which shows the cultural impact of these colorful symbols. A recent report claims that roughly
three quarters of Internet users communicate with emojis on a regular basis <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEmogiResearch2016">100</a>]</span>. While
image-based passwords were proposed decades ago (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-620002.5.1">2.5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:graphical_pws --></a>), the recent success of
emojis has given graphical authentication new momentum.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Emojis are an opportunity to increase security, because they can add more complexity to
passwords. Adding an emoji to a weak password like <span 
class="ectt-1200">iloveyou </span>could already make it less
predictable, e.g. <span 
class="ectt-1200">iloveyouXygp</span>. We have also seen that users’ mental models are built
around complexity, and not necessarily around length. Thus, an emoji-password like
<span 
class="ectt-1200">Corr3ctXygpXygpXygp </span>might be perceived as more secure than the original passphrase. Past
studies have also shown that graphical authentication can benefit from the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">picture superiority effect</span>.
Hence, using emojis inside passwords might have usability advantages, and we also see them as an
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">enabling technology </span>that empowers users to pick more creative and memorable secrets, i.e., a
persuasive design strategy. At the same time, existing authentication back-ends do not require
significant changes to make emoji-passwords work. Since emojis are encoded as regular characters,
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
the only potential change is to use a different version of UTF. Theoretically, 90% of
web-pages are compatible with emojis in password fields already now (see Footnote <a 
href="#x110-332001f1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: foot:emoji-standard --></a>).
Consequently, some service providers have started to allow emojis as part of user-chosen
passwords also on the back-end. Twitter, Slack and StackOverflow are among these
pioneers.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >However, the adoption comes with certain risks. Emojis are primarily used on mobile devices
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEmogiResearch2016">100</a>]</span>. Hence, adding emojis to passwords on a smartphone is easy, but there might be
problems when the user tries to enter their emoji-password on a desktop: Typical input
solutions possible with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">software </span>keyboards get left out on the desktop. Some applications
have enabled indirect emoji input through the mouse in a graphical user interface, so
it is not impossible to enter an emoji-password across different platforms. On the
other hand, the specific images used to render emojis are platform-dependent: a bird
emoji on a native iOS soft-keyboard looks different on Android (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). This
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fragmentation</span><span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss113.html#fn3x44"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x110-332003f3"></a>
introduces new issues not typically found with other graphical authentication schemes,
where there is more control over the images. Thus, we wanted to understand the usability
factors and constraints of emoji-passwords to gauge the feasibility of this authentication
mechanism.

are “picture words” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTaggart2015NewWords">325</a>]</span>. They are primarily used in mobile messaging applications like
WhatsApp, iMessage, and alike, to express emotions and add subtext in messages. Before emojis
arrived, this has been possible with <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">emoticons</span>, i.e. combinations of regular characters that convey
emotions like <span 
class="ectt-1200">:-)&#x003C;3 </span>and <span 
class="ectt-1200">:-O</span>. However, emojis are visually richer and much more versatile. The
current version of the Unicode standard lists around 2800 emojis (see Footnote <a 
href="#x110-339005f7">7<!--tex4ht:ref: foot:full-list-of-emojis --></a>) categorized by
topics, and roughly 150 are added each year. In 2015, emojis saw a stark increase in usage
numbers. Both iOS and Android added special software keyboards that allowed users
to easily enter emojis through direct touch input. Often, users replace entire words or
blocks of text with emojis. Although emojis are useful to overcome language barriers,
their meaning is not always clear <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMiller2015BlissfullyHappyEmoji">234</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XTigwell2016EmojiMisunderstandings">335</a>]</span>. Researchers have started to investigate
misinterpretation in many ways, and have proposed solutions like a “disambiguation API”

<!--l. 60--><p class="noindent" >The growing adoption rates of emojis in various application areas has not gone
unnoticed by the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:USEC">USEC</a> community, who started trying to improve authentication
schemes with emojis. One of the first solutions was presented by Intelligent

Their <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">emoji-passcode </span>system would allow customers to select four emojis from a 9x5 grid to log
into mobile banking apps. However, the concept has not been widely adopted. Golla et al.,
respectively Kraus et al., proposed a similar system that was targeted at screen-locks for mobiles
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGolla2017EmojiAuth">136</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XKraus2017Emoji">203</a>]</span>. In essence, their EmojiAuth system replaces each digit on a PIN-pad with an emoji. In
two user studies, they evaluated the concept and showed that both security and usability of unlock
mechanisms can be improved this way. On the other hand, we were able to find only one
publication about using emojis as part of an alphanumeric password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAlHusainy2015EmojiPasswords">9</a>]</span>. Al-Husainy
and Mali focused on user-account passwords on desktop computers but did not present
an empirical evaluation of the concept. We believe web pages and mobile applications
are the primary use case for emoji-based authentication. This application area is still
underexplored.

 id="x110-33700011.1.3"></a>Research Opportunities</h4>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >The combination of emojis and alphanumeric characters generates a wide range of research
questions, and we can only answer a small subset of them. In particular, we explore password
selection strategies that may hint at potentially risky behavior. It is likely that emoji-passwords
share some traits of alphanumeric passwords. For instance, the topology of a password is an
important metric to gauge its guessability. Therefore, we would expect to observe some topologies
reported by Weir et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">365</a>]</span>, Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>, and Kuo et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic">206</a>]</span>. The latter indicated
that some users had already used emoticons inside passwords in 2005. Although we
cannot realistically measure guessability of emoji-passwords at this time, we can explore
emerging patterns. For instance, we can elicit where users put their emoji and how they
choose it. Emoji-passwords are a hybrid between knowledge- and recognition-based
authentication, so they demand effort from both the lexical and visual memory <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2009VisualSnakeOil">265</a>]</span>. Therefore,
this approach could turn out to be either a memorability advantage or disadvantage.
Since the answer to this question is very open, we refrain from generating hypotheses
altogether.

<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >The project focused on using emoji-passwords on web sites, therefore we built a web-based
prototype with standard technologies (PHP, HTML5, JavaScript). We identified two solutions to
enter emojis on a desktop computer: via a point-and-click interface, and “shortcodes”. Most
web-versions of messenger applications, e.g. WhatsApp Web, Telegram Web, Hangouts, etc., use
the point-and-click approach (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). A few communication tools also allow entering a
predefined word that is then translated into an emoji. This <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">shortcode </span>often needs to be put into
braces, e.g. (smile) on Skype, or stand between two colons, e.g. :smile: on Slack (see Figure
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). We implemented a prototype based on point-and-click selection and Slack-style
shortcodes. However, shortcodes were not auto-completed, which is generally discouraged
for passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span> and there was no “recent emoji” feature. After clicking an emoji,
the prototype did not use the unicode character inside the password field for technical
reasons<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss116.html#fn6x44"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x110-339004f6"></a>.
Instead, the shortcode was automatically inserted and masked. To allow checking the entered
password, it was displayed in plain text beneath the input fields (see Figure <a 
href="#x110-342002r2">11.6b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:emojipasswords:policy-memo-instruction --></a>).
</p><!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >While Unicode v11.0 contained 2789 emojis<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss117.html#fn7x44"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x110-339005f7"></a>,
we reduced the number of available emojis to 50 for several reasons. First, we found through
iterative testing that there was a selection bias, if the full range of emojis was offered; testers mostly
included emojis from the first page. Second, Golla et al. used a similar approach for their
EmojiAuth system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGolla2017EmojiAuth">136</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XKraus2017Emoji">203</a>]</span>. Last, reducing the number very likely facilitates recognition and
potentially increases the memorability of the emoji-password.
</p><!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >The 50 emojis were selected with particular features in mind. To evaluate issues arising from similarity,
around a third of emojis should mutually resemble each other. Fragmentation issues during
authentication can only be seen for emojis whose appearance strongly differs on other platforms.
Moreover, the emojis should appeal to users, e.g. because they are familiar with them. To achieve
this, different emoji-categories should be considered. We identified 50 suitable candidates from the

<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" >For the first part, participants were invited to a lab at the media informatics research group. The
primary task was to create a password that participants could remember well. There was no
independent variable for the password selection task, thus participants all received the same study
instructions.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >We logged the chosen emojis and their positions inside the passwords. Moreover, we analyzed
password characteristics with zxcvbn and stored this to the database along with the hashed
password. As an indicator for usability of either the picker or the shortcodes, we measured the time
taken to select the password. Here, we used the “focus” and “blur” events as start and end
points.
</p><!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >On the qualitative side, we used ordinal five-point scales to collect attitudinal data about using
emojis inside passwords, the picker, and shortcodes. Demographic data and self-reported password

study was protocolled.
</p><!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x110-34200011.2.2"></a>Procedure</h5>
<!--l. 145--><p class="noindent" >After an in-depth briefing on the purpose of the study and data collection practices, an experimenter
explained each step of the study. We provided a standard desktop PC to complete the tasks, which
were mostly self-guided. First, participants created a user ID. Since they were going to need this ID
later on to allow us matching the lab and field data, we provided a simple algorithm to create an
ID. Participants were asked to take the first letter of both their parents’ first names and
their own birth place, appended by the digit of their birth month (e.g. “IKP10”). This
algorithm, albeit not perfectly random, was sufficient to protect <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PII">personally identifiable
information</a>.
</p><!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" >This was followed by a questionnaire on demographic data, password coping strategies and
attitudes towards emojis in passwords, e.g. “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">how likely would you consider using emojis in a</span>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password?</span>” At this point of the study, participants had not yet created an emoji-password, so their
attitudes were not biased by the tasks that followed. We also briefed them about the difference
between “emojis” and “emoticons” to avoid misinterpretation.
</p><!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >Afterwards, participants completed the password selection task using the prototype. A significant
part of the screen was dedicated to list all emojis and their short codes. To provide sufficient
background information and introduce a realistic risk <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">205</a>]</span>, the task included a scenario. It asked
participants to imagine that they had used WhatsApp for some time and now a new security
precaution is introduced. As a safety measure, they were now required to prove their identity with a
password upon activating WhatsApp on a new device. The password needed to consist
of at least eight alphanumeric characters and at least one emoji. Participants then had
to repeat the selected password, and tick a box to confirm that they had memorized it
(see Figure <a 
href="#x110-342002r2">11.6b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:emojipasswords:policy-memo-instruction --></a>). This was followed-up through a reflective self-assessment of their
behavior during the study (cf. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">103</a>]</span>), and a structured questionnaire on their selection
strategies.
</p><!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >The study concluded with an interpretation task of two given emojis, namely the “information desk
person” (Xygp) and “folded hands” (Xygp). Those were not available during password selection,
and we intended to assess their suitability for future inclusion. In total, the whole session duration
was below 15 minutes.

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 4</span>). We elicited selection strategies in two ways: a list
of probable strategies that we identified in pre-tests, and an open question where participants were
asked to describe their method in detail. Half of the participants indicated that they used an emoji
that fits the alphanumeric part of the password. Four said that they preferred an emoji that they
frequently use, while another four chose an emoji at random. The remaining participants either
associated the picture to a life event (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 3</span>) or hobby (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 1</span>). Eight participants elaborated on
their tactics in high detail, and their strategies were more individual than the predefined
categories.
</p><!--l. 239--><p class="noindent" >Through collaborative thematic analysis, a method similar to affinity diagramming, we identified
themes in all qualitative statements and the think-aloud protocol. After the first round of coding,
there were 42 codes that were further reduced in an axial coding step. The resulting overall themes
were: </p>
  <ul class="itemize1">
  <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Internal  consistency:  </span>The  emoji  semantically  matches  the  alphanumeric  part  of  the
  password, e.g. putting a camel emoji Xygp after the Greek word for “heat” (P26).
  </li>
  <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Context  cues:  </span>The  password  contains  a  hint  to  the  participant’s  location  or  to  its
  purpose. For instance, participants used the computer emoji Xygp because they created
  the password on a PC (P34). Another participant picked the check mark Xygp because it
  stands for <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">completing </span>the study (P38).
  </li>
  <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Replacement:  </span>The  emoji  replaces  either  a  letter  or  an  entire  word.  For  instance,  P17
  replaced the letter “p” in their password with a penguin Xygp because both <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">words </span>begin
  with the same letter.
  </li>
  <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Appeal: </span>The emoji visually or emotionally appealed to the participants (mentioned twice
  for the flower emoji Xygp)
  </li>
  <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Liking: </span>Participants had an affection or personal connection to the emoji, e.g. penguins
  Xygp.
  </li>
  <li class="itemize"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Usability  and  Security:  </span>An  emoji  that  serves  to  increase  usability  or  security  of  the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
  password. Usability could be improved either with a particularly easy-to-type shortcode
  (:grin:),  or  by  choosing  emojis  that  “stand  out  from  the  rest,  because  they  look  too
  similar” (P32, chose the penguin). Security was achieved through perceived randomness
  or unpredictability (mentioned twice for the diamond Xygp).</li></ul>
<!--l. 249--><p class="noindent" >Within those six themes, we can see a common story line: The selection strategies can be read as an
attempt to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">improve memorability </span>of the password. Most participants intuitively focused on
creating a password that they could easily recall. None of them mentioned the option to write down
the emoji-password or store it externally. The selected emojis thus matched individual
memorization approaches.

enter emojis on a desktop computer in both modalities. Interestingly, the three participants who
tried both methods started with the picker and then continued to use the short codes, because they
found it more convenient.
</p><!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >Through a qualitative analysis of the think aloud protocol we found that participants considered the
advantages and disadvantages of both input methods. The picker was perceived as easy and fast to
use, while being less prone to typing errors. Often, participants mentioned that they were already
familiar with this entry method (e.g. from WhatsApp web), so they did not have to learn anything
new. On the other hand, they described the progressive disclosure paradigm as potential
problem, because the button that triggers the picker could be overlooked. Also, some
mentioned that it is cumbersome to switch between mouse and keyboard. Those who
used the shortcodes appreciated the speed of entry and low effort to add the emoji to the
password. However, learning and memorizing the corresponding codes were seen as the main
drawbacks. The sentiments did not significantly change in the second part of the study

participants made a deliberate choice about the chosen input method and they were happy with
it.

In the control group, who saw the identical emoji set, five participants failed to log in after a week
and 15 succeeded. The experimental group, who received the Android version of the emojis,
counted six log-in failures, while 13 participants were able to authenticate despite the change of

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">1</span>), which is probably owed to the
sample size. The medians of failed attempts, which are potentially more descriptive in this
situation, did differ: the control group’s median was 0, while it was 1 in the experimental
group. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> visualizes successful and unsuccessful login attempts in high detail.
There, we can trace back the emoji that were included in incorrectly entered passwords.
Success and failure rates in the “Animals &#x0026; Nature” category were balanced in both
groups. However, participants were twice as likely to fail in the experimental group, if
their password contained an emoji from the “Smileys &#x0026; People” category. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>
shows that emojis differing strongly from the iOS version were more associated with
login failures. “Symbols” were the category with the highest failure rate across both
groups.

any differences in the appearance of the emoji. Although the emojis remained identical in the
control group, 7 out of the 20 participants indicated that they had noticed a change. This is hard to
interpret, but we assume that they meant the order of the emoji inside the 10x5 grid. In the
experimental group, where emojis did in fact <span

(84%) talked about this change in the response field. Eight of them did not perceive
the alteration as troublesome, while another eight felt that identifying the right emoji
was challenging. For three participants, the change of emoji-type was insurmountable:
One participant was very sure to have selected the correct emoji, because she picked a
“happy face” to express herself. However, she reported to have failed because she was
unable to pick the correct emoji in the second study session. Another participant, who
successfully authenticated with his emoji-password, indicated that he could only find the right
emoji after a Google search. Finally, one participant mentioned that he was troubled by
the different versions of the check mark, so he used a trial and error approach until he
succeeded.

Xygp). Thematic analyses showed a wide range of themes for the “service person” emoji. A total of
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
14 distinct themes were visible, each mentioned by at least two participants. Most often, this
emoji was associated with “female” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 6</span>) and “pointing” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 5</span>). The emoji depicts a
bell-hop’s “tipping gesture”, which was interpreted as “sassy” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 2</span>) or “bossy” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 4</span>),
too. Regarding the “praying hands” emoji, participants reached higher consensus on
its meaning. Seven themes emerged from the word associations. Most commonly, the
participants mentioned “pray” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 19</span>) and “beg” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 9</span>). These anecdotal examples highlight
the problems produced by unclear meanings of emojis. For passwords, on the other
hand, a bigger range of interpretations opens up more opportunities to create a story with
emojis.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11.3.7    </span> <a 
 id="x110-35900011.3.7"></a>Limitations</h4>
<!--l. 302--><p class="noindent" >The results presented above need to be interpreted in the light of a few important limitations. First,
the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">sample size </span>was not large enough to bring about statistically significant test results. Naturally,
the null hypotheses (e.g. fragmentation does not affect recall) could be true, but with 40
participants, we lack some statistical power to draw conclusive inferences, especially with a
frequentist approach (which emoji was chosen <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">how often</span>). Nevertheless, we saw emerging patterns
that can be followed up with a quantitative user study. Our primary goal was the exploration of
fragmentation and input issues, as well as attitudes. Our participants belonged to the user group
who would be most likely to try out emoji-passwords. This makes us confident the trends at least
point into the right direction. To explore additional dimensions of the problem space
around emoji-passwords, considering a more diverse sample is going to be useful in the
future.
</p><!--l. 305--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, much of the elicited data is attitudinal, potentially affecting ecological validity of the
study. However, we tried to mitigate issues by providing a realistic scenario and had them gauge
their behavior. Here, most claimed they acted like they normally would, which has been shown to
be a useful indicator as to the trustworthiness of the data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">103</a>]</span>. Nonetheless, emoji-passwords
constituted an unfamiliar paradigm for all participants, despite their familiarity with both emojis
and passwords separately. Therefore, novelty effects are possible in that participants might have
spent more time to explore the possibilities than they normally would. However, subjective
usability assessments on the feasibility of emoji-passwords were reserved nonetheless. This
indicates that respondents critically balanced the pros and cons and did not only focus on the
benefits.

feasibility of emoji-passwords.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">11.4.1    </span> <a 
 id="x110-36100011.4.1"></a>Selection Strategies and Their Implications</h4>
<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >It was evident that participants were keen on creating a <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">memorable password</span>. So although people
were enabled to select a richer and more diverse password, we observed well-known reactions. The
selection strategies were a direct translation of their usual patterns. Many of them noted that they
were able to easily include emojis in their long-established strategies and coping behavior. As a
consequence, we observed predictable patterns in selection strategies leading to simple attack
vectors: participants favored items that helped them maintain their existing selection strategies,
which can be exploited to adapt cracking techniques. We can read this as a bad sign, because emojis
do not appear to break existing behavior, and only increase the theoretical space of creation
strategies. At this point it is difficult to gauge practical security advantages entailed by
enlarging the character set. Learning from past roll-outs of new authentication schemes,
password <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strength </span>is unlikely to increase drastically by the use of emojis. On the other
hand, user-selected passwords have always shown predictable patterns and adding emojis
probably will not aggravate the situation further. Therefore, the only major advantage
of allowing users to pick emoji-passwords can be an improvement in how password
authentication is perceived. In other words, it might help the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:UX"><span

data is helpful to identify the pitfalls that need to be considered to achieve good UX of

 id="x110-36300011.4.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Freedom to choose</span></span>
Good UX starts with respect and empathy. Users should not be forced to use emojis in their
passwords. Our data discourages the use of a policy that mandates emojis, which a quarter of
participants found annoying. Our first study on personality factors showed a large variety of
thinking styles about policies (cf. Section <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1830007.2">7.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:personality:study-1 --></a>). Therefore, we argue in favor of autonomy
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
and leaving it up to users to decide whether they want to use an emoji as part of their
password(s). So, users are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">empowered </span>to change their behavior and might be persuaded to do
so.

<!--l. 332--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x110-36400011.4.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Learning Curve</span></span>
Once users understand that they have the freedom to use emoji-passwords, the learning curve for
this task looks fairly gentle. Our sample consisted of users who were already familiar with entering
emojis on the desktop and therefore immediately knew what to do. Less experienced user groups
should be offered assistance in case they decide to experiment with emoji-passwords. We also
found that the short codes were mainly used by participants who aimed for efficiency. Thus, there is
nothing wrong with enabling short codes for input, but it should be tailored to an advanced user
group.

 id="x110-36500011.4.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Pragmatic Constraints for Passwords</span></span>
Although our sample came from a population of young adults who are highly experienced with
emojis, some participants clearly struggled to identify the correct emoji after we exchanged the
renderings. Therefore, inconsistencies across platforms could become a show-stopper. At the
moment, there are a few problems that contribute to creating inconsistent experiences. First,
although emojis are standardized Unicode <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">code-points</span>, vendors usually need to create custom
emoji-<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">pictures </span>for legal reasons. Sets under a public domain or nonrestrictive licenses do exist,
but many vendors prefer shipping custom on-brand experiences with a shared design
language across their products. On the other hand, it could be useful to form alliances
like the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:W3C">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a> to standardize graphical assets of emojis
specifically for password-fields. Software keyboards on mobiles would also need to match this
hypothetical “password-emoji standard”. As of now, emojis offered by built-in software
keyboards often look different to those of certain apps (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). To solve this
inconsistency, a native keyboard could offer an interface that lets the app inject a consistent set of
emojis.
</p><!--l. 346--><p class="noindent" >After settling on a shared visual representation of emojis, distinctiveness is another critical factor.
Some emoji-tuples that look very similar to each other can be troublesome. One of our participants
mentioned this issue already in his selection strategy, because he was looking for an emoji that
“stands out” and did not “look like the others”. To avoid login failures from confusion,
there needs to be a whitelist of emojis that only contains the highly distinctive ones. We
can first derive a candidate list based on geometric parameters like shape and color,
and then proceed to evaluate them through quantitative user research with a diverse
sample.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 349--><p class="noindent" >A final challenge pertaining to the constraints of emoji-passwords are hard usability metrics like
efficiency. Higher degree of freedom and creativity support are ineffective if users need to browse
through large lists of emojis only to find the correct item. Reducing the emoji-space to a subset
emerges as a useful approach to speed up recognition and efficiency. At the same time, it is
conceivable that vendors stick to a limited, static subset that is randomly selected from the whitelist
of distinct emojis. Distinct subsets, i.e. a different random permutation per vendor, can also
mitigate password reuse.

 id="x110-36600011.5"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 375--><p class="noindent" >In this project, we empirically evaluated the usage of emojis in regular alphanumeric passwords to
gauge their suitability as persuasive alternative to existing passwords. Our mixed-model
user study with forty participants focused on attitudinal and usability aspects. From the
selection behavior, memorability results and qualitative feedback we can conclude that
emojis do not necessarily lead to memorable passwords (RQ1). Participants wanted to
translate their usual password selection behavior to the new paradigm and at least tried to
create memorable passwords (RQ4). When participants failed to log in, this could be
partially traced back to fragmentation, i.e. differences in the visual representation of the
same emoji characters (RQ2). Our sample population was experienced with emojis,
but still struggled to match Android emojis to a previously selected iOS emoji. Their
personal experience allowed them to easily understand how to enter emoji-passwords on
desktops through a graphical point-and-click interface (RQ3). Nevertheless, our prototype
made potential usability problems salient for participants and thus their attitudes towards
adopting emoji-passwords in the future were reserved (RQ5). Thus, the persuasive power of
emoji-passwords was limited, which we attribute to the user experience of the study
setting.
</p><!--l. 378--><p class="noindent" >Some vendors and service providers have already enabled emoji support for passwords. For instance,
Twitter<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss120.html#fn10x44"><sup class="textsuperscript">10</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x110-366001f10"></a>
allows users to take advantage of this rich character set. The issues we explored in our study thus
affect a growing number of users already now. Roadmaps to address fragmentation and input issues
do not exist at this point. However, more and more users are going to find out about the capabilities,
perhaps because the feature is presented in blog- and news articles <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDashinsky2015NoEmojisInPWs">69</a>]</span>. Therefore, the HCI
community should act quick to create a better authentication experience to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">scale solutions before</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">problems are going to scale</span>. Realistically, the propositions and requirements discussed in Section
<a 
href="#x110-36500011.4.2">11.4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:emojipasswords:unique-constraints --></a> would require intensive negotiation substantiated with much more user testing data. It is
unclear whether vendors are willing to make this investment. We argue that a standardized
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">emoji-password-picker </span>with a random sub-set of white-listed, distinctive emojis is a
desirable goal. The “longer term solutions” that are part of the Unicode standard (see
Footnote <a 
href="#x110-332001f1">1<!--tex4ht:ref: foot:emoji-standard --></a>) embrace “embedded graphics”, which paves the way to mitigate fragmentation
issues. Since leading tech companies have worked together on the standardization of
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
emojis in the past, it would be fruitful to collaborate on authentication issues of emojis,
too.

 id="x110-36700011.5"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Future Work</span></span>
Our prototype did not deliver the best possible user experience. This caveat was partially owed to
isolating confounding factors. For instance, a finished solution would not shuffle the order of
emojis as we did. Future studies on emoji-passwords need to intensely study different dimensions
of user experience issues and potentials. To better understand the current state of emoji-passwords,
a diary study might be worthwhile. It would be possible to answer interesting questions on how this
novel kind of authentication influences well-established coping strategies. For instance, is it
possible to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">write down emoji-passwords</span>, and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">share </span>them with somebody else? Can <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">password</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">managers </span>already handle them? Do users take more care to protect emoji-passwords from
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">shoulder surfers</span>? Such questions can further help judge the feasibility of this approach and
identify important pain points.
</p><!--l. 387--><p class="noindent" >At the same time, we saw how existing coping strategies might lead to weak emoji-passwords.
Therefore, as a next step, the security benefits should be quantified. Perhaps, this is relatively easy
to do with an <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a> study. If our hunch about weak selection strategies is confirmed, persuasive
strength feedback for emoji-passwords is an important future research direction. Real-time
password meters, particularly those based on zxcvbn, are currently unable to realistically
gauge the strength of emoji-passwords. Therefore, further work on modeling strength is
necessary. Neural networks, as shown by Melicher et al., could respect the predictability
of user-chosen emojis in guess-number estimates <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">233</a>]</span>. All in all, some more work is
going to be necessary to reach the high persuasive power of emoji-passwords that we
had hoped for. Our work has laid the foundations for such studies on the quantitative
side.
