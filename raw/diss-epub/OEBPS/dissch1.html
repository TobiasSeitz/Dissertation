<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >We have become accustomed to using multiple passwords every day: We enter a four-digit PIN to
unlock our phone to check incoming messages even before breakfast. Paywalls shield the news
of the day, so they force us to log into our favorite news website before we can read
them during our commute. Once arrived at work, our fingers automatically type the
password to unlock the computer. A colleague requests access to a client’s platform, so we
write down the credentials or share them via a password manager that itself is password
protected. When we come home, we find the kids have used the family’s tablet to log into
their social media accounts, so we need to re-authenticate if we want to check our own.
Interacting with systems relying on password authentication has become ubiquitous,
and we merely carry out the task. Passwords are the de facto standard when it comes to
controlling access to resources on the Internet. While it may seem straightforward to deal with
passwords because we are so acquainted with them, there is a wide range of problems they
entail: The phone requests the PIN whenever we take it out of our pocket, so we spend
considerable time per day authenticating <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>. The news website informs us that our
password has expired, so we need to pick a new one that is not part of the ones we had used
before. The work PC requires not only our credentials but also a one-time password that
our phone generates for us every sixty seconds. At one point, the colleague leaves the
company, so we have to request a new set of credentials from the client to maintain
confidentiality. And the kids used the tablet at home to shop online because we had stored
the password in the browser for convenience. So, we delete the stored password but
fail to recall it a week later, because we had not typed it for a very long time. These
and other situations lead to users feeling a considerable burden generated by password
authentication.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x3-80001.1"></a>The State of the World</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In a wide sense, password authentication encompasses digit-only <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PIN">personal identification numbers
(PINs)</a>, graphical schemes like the Android screen lock pattern (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-620002.5.1">2.5.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:graphical_pws --></a>), and
alphanumeric passwords consisting of letters and digits. Throughout this thesis, however, we focus
on the latter because they still are the go-to method on the Internet: In 2007, users had around 25
accounts and roughly six distinct passwords on average <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>]</span>, while more recent numbers suggest
that users keep twelve unique passwords for different purposes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>. With the growing number of
accounts the issues around passwords amplify: users pick weak passwords, write them
down in unprotected locations, reuse many of them, forget the exotic ones, and share
credentials with other people <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. These behaviors are referred to as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password coping</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strategies</span>.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Combating the risks entailed by these issues, researchers and practitioners have developed
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
numerous approaches to support users in password authentication. Four central themes have
emerged in their efforts: education, enforcement, assistance, and persuasion.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-90001.1"></a>Education</h5>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Weak password practices were attributed to a lack of understanding of the consequences for the
longest time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2001WeakestLink">276</a>]</span>. Thus, first approaches to mitigate the situation leaned on educating users
through trainings, and textual instructions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2009SoLongThanksExternalities">162</a>]</span>. Explaining all risks and defense strategies to users
in lengthy prose is doomed to fail, because password security is a secondary goal that is
dominated by a primary task, e.g., reading emails <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWhitten1999WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt">371</a>]</span>. Nevertheless, carefully crafted
advice and explanations may be a viable strategy for those who actively seek information
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-100001.1"></a>Enforcement</h5>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Since the inception of passwords in the 1960s, users have tried to create memorable passwords that
are often based on simple dictionary words. To combat low complexity, enforcing password rules
through policies is commonplace. Passwords must then meet length and complexity requirements,
e.g., a certain number of uppercase letters, digits, or symbols. The choice of a specific
policy is not trivial for service providers, and many organizations make poor tradeoffs
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">112</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">295</a>]</span>. The plethora of policies even fosters insecure password practices, because users
try to find easy ways to comply with the rules, which they do in very predictable ways
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-110001.1"></a>Assistance</h5>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Users have to deal with a high number of passwords that also interfere with each other, so people
reuse passwords and write them down on paper or digital files. To lower the risks entailed by these
coping strategies, assistive tools like <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">password managers (PWMs)</a> and password generators
automate certain interactions to boost both security and usability. However, they come
at a price, e.g., lock-in effects to a particular vendor that make it difficult to move to
a different tool in the future. Thus, many users rationally refrain from adopting them
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCSID2012PasswordHabits">64</a>]</span>.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-120001.1"></a>Persuasion</h5>
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the youngest strategy to support users in password authentication is based on principles of
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">persuasive technology</span>. Fogg defined this paradigm as “any interactive computing system designed
to change people’s attitudes and behaviors” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFogg2002Persuasive">120</a>, p. 1]</span>. While assistive systems also often meet that
particular goal, persuasive technology tries to create sustainable impact even when the assistive
trigger is absent. Therefore, such interventions often come as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">behavior-change support systems</span>
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOinas-Kukkonen2013BCSS">246</a>]</span>. In the realm of authentication, password meters are the most representative form of
persuasive interventions. Those <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:UI">user interface (UI)</a> elements often appear on registration pages of
web services, and give feedback on the strength of a user-selected password. They often implement
various <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">nudges</span>, i.e. small transparent attempts to change behaviors <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XThaler2008Nudge">332</a>, p. 4]</span>, to convince the user
to pick a more suitable password. The user stays in control and is free to move on without
following the advice. Overcoming inertia is perhaps the biggest challenge in the design of
persuasive password support. So far, the use of nudges has shown mixed results in empirical
research <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">267</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>, and the spectrum of persuasive interventions in the wild is fairly
narrow.

 id="x3-130001.2"></a>Problem Statement and Research Objectives</h3>
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Password-related challenges and risks for the users are at the heart of this dissertation. The balance
between usability and security, especially for passwords, has been under investigation for several
decades. This allows us to observe tectonic shifts in the hassles that users have to bear. The notion
of the inconsiderate user, who is the “weakest link” in the authentication chain and notoriously
refuses security measures, has started to crumble: There is considerable evidence that many users
want more control over their security and that they are willing to give up usability for it <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKessem2018IBMFutureIdentity">192</a>]</span>. This
sacrifice might not even be necessary, nor lie in their best interest, which I illustrate
below.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x3-140001.2.1"></a>Balancing the Costs</h4>
<!--l. 38--><p class="noindent" >Changing the status quo of the authentication world can be seen as a game-theoretic problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2015ImperfectAuthentication">35</a>]</span>.
It involves risks and opportunities that need to be balanced in terms of their costs for different

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-150001.2.1"></a>Maintaining Usable Password Practices</h5>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Fortunately, the costs of being attacked remain hypothetical for many users <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. However, there is
a growing number of people who have experienced an attack with all its consequences to resolve
the damage and recover from it <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBKA2016Bundeslagebild">45</a>]</span>. First, usable but risky password practices, like
excessive reuse and obvious password choices, can cause financial losses for end-users. For
instance, an attacker who manages to impersonate a user might be able to withdraw
money from bank accounts. At the moment, attacks on digital wallets containing
cryptocurrency are highly lucrative, so protecting these assets with strong passwords is
vital<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss4.html#fn1x2"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x3-15001f1"></a>.
Herley et al. noted that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“money is the most obvious loss, but time, frustration and reputation are</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">also at stake” </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>, let alone the emotional distress <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014ReligiousAunt">296</a>]</span>. Accounts that have a weak password are
more likely to be hijacked <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWang2016TargetedGuessingUnderestimated">358</a>]</span>, and it often takes victims painful effort to recover from identity
theft<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss5.html#fn2x2"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x3-15002f2"></a>.
Although social engineering, where an attacker lures people into forfeiting their credentials, is a central
threat for companies, the employees’ overall password practices still generate considerable financial
losses<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss6.html#fn3x2"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x3-15003f3"></a>.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-160001.2.1"></a>Striving for Stronger Password Practices</h5>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >Solving the problems raised by passwords, we also need to consider the other end of the
security-usability spectrum. Moving to strong password practices often inflates usability challenges
for users that are largely neglected by security experts. For instance, typing an overly
complex password takes long and is error prone <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>. Such passwords are especially
tedious to enter on mobile phones or devices that were not originally designed for text
input, e.g., smart TV sets <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span>. Moreover, most people are incapable of creating and
memorizing a strong, unique password for every single account on their own. So, it is
unrealistic to expect that they will do so without the use of external aids like handwritten
notes or password managers. The cost of using such methods is a dependency on the
tools that users did not ask for in the first place. In any case, strong passwords are no
panacea in boosting online security. They do not stand a chance in fending off social
engineering attacks where the victim unwillingly surrenders the password in plain text. In an
effort to alleviate the risks of unknowingly forfeited credentials, service providers often
require users to reset passwords after a given period. Such expiration policies are rather
ineffective <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2015QuantifyingExpiration">53</a>]</span> and responsible for many support desk calls whose resolutions are costly
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>]</span>.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x3-170001.2.2"></a>The Challenge: Improving an Innately Annoying Interaction</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Passwords are annoying for users, and as we can see above, there is no easy solution to alleviate
this situation. It is impossible to remove all usability pain points <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">34</a>]</span>. Yet, no alternative can fully
replace passwords, either (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-610002.5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:authentication_without_pws --></a>). Thus, Herley and Van Oorschot point out that
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“supporting passwords better is a vast opportunity for improvement” </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>, because making even a
small change can have an impact on so many users.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Up until now, persuasive strategies have produced mixed results regarding their efficacy in
supporting users with passwords. This could be due to several issues: Mental models and
coping strategies evolve over time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">352</a>]</span>, which has seen little attention in the design
of persuasive interventions. Much of the past research dealt with one-shot triggers in
isolation, but many context factors and costs for different stakeholders were left out. In an
analogy to the design principle “form follows function”, a better understanding of the
functions of user support can help design assistive and persuasive solutions (the form).
Moreover, many highly effective nudges from other domains have not been adapted for
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
password support, so we simply may not have discovered the best intervention, yet.
However, since nudging strategies are nuanced, we need a structured exploration of
how we can bring them to password authentication to remove its most important pain
points.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3    </span> <a 
 id="x3-190001.3"></a>Main Contributions</h3>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >As highlighted above, several aspects of password support have been left out in the literature,
although there are many reasons to consider their importance. First and foremost, a broader
understanding of contextual factors that contribute to the formation of specific coping strategies is
necessary to improve password support. The primary goal of this thesis is to provide this
understanding on a fundamental level by exploring existing factors and addressing them with
persuasive designs. The solutions include new paradigms for the design of persuasive
interventions.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-200001.3"></a>Insights into Context Factors of Password Practices</h5>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >Researchers seem to have reached consensus that the context in which a password goes through its
life-cycle <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span> is an explanatory variable for users’ practices. However, contextual factors have
merely been addressed in the discussions of empirical findings. Only a few studies specifically
correlated users’ backgrounds to their password practices (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKessem2018IBMFutureIdentity">192</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>) and they mostly focused
on demographic factors. We contribute several insights that enrich the understanding of a
wide range of context factors. Specifically, we address how users’ mental models are
associated with their password practices. We do this through a novel method to study
mental models in-the wild with the aid of a game. Moreover, we are the first to thoroughly
investigate the interconnection between personality traits and password authentication.
The insights gathered in three online studies revealed interesting associations between
personality, attitudes, and behaviors regarding passwords. Lastly, we performed an extensive
audit of the real-world constraints that form the context for password reuse. All these
insights shape our understanding of the problem space as the foundation for persuasive
interventions.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x3-210001.3"></a>Investigation of Persuasive Strategies</h5>
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >With the context factors in mind, we extended the range of persuasive design strategies. As a
starting point, we investigated users’ explicit and implicit needs in password feedback. From this
exploration, we contribute the “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">show-explain-help-empower</span>” paradigm that serves as a heuristic for
persuasive password assistance. We followed this up with two studies that were carried
out both in the lab and in the field: The first study was the first of its kind to evaluate
the Decoy effect for choice architectures in password authentication. Here we learned
important lessons about the interplay between feedback and feedforward, and about the role
of simplification in persuasion. The second study was focused on empowerment. We
evaluated different dimensions of usability of emojis inside text-based passwords. The study
delivers timely insights, because an increasing number of web-services enable users to
pick such emoji-passwords and there are some issues that need attention from the very
start.

they do follow a narrative, it is possible to read them in any order by following the provided

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Singular They:</span></span>
Throughout this dissertation pronouns are used in the plural although speaking about an individual,
e.g. “the user” is mostly referred to as “they” instead of “he” or “she”, to avoid discrimination of
certain demographic groups.

As is common in HCI literature, the author utilizes “We” instead of “I” to acknowledge the work of
collaborators. In later more opinionated parts, the explicit usage of “I” intends to communicate the
subjective nature of thoughts and interpretations.
