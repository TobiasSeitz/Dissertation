<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >In the previous chapter, we reached the conclusion that users’ mental models of password strength
are fairly accurate with some exceptions. We can thus expect that users at least try to create strong
passwords if they deem the account worth protecting. However, this is only one side of
the coin: Even if users succeed in creating a very strong password, they still have to
manage a multitude of accounts. Therefore, password reuse is rampant. Although it is
necessary to some degree <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">116</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">389</a>]</span>, it remains hard to defend against. At the same time,
password reuse might expose users to an even greater risk than weak passwords. In case
an attacker obtains a user’s plain text password, they gain access to all accounts that
share this strong password. Studies have shown that users tend to underestimate the
risks generated by password reuse <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKaspersky2016ConsumerSecurityReport">186</a>]</span>. In fact, password reuse can render the security
advantages of picking a very strong password void, which is not immediately understood by
users.
</p><!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >As explained in Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1000003.3.1">3.3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:policies --></a>, password composition policies are one of the interventions targeted
at weak passwords. However, in many cases users fulfill requirements in predictable
ways, so policies often fail their primary goal. If password policies do not always benefit
password strength, could they at least prevent password reuse? Heterogeneous policies
across different web sites with mutually exclusive requirements could effectively disallow
users to reuse passwords like they tend to do. In this chapter, we investigate password
policies of one hundred of the most-visited web-services in Germany. This extensive audit
should answer our research question “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Do password policies prevent password reuse?</span>”
We shed light on the findings and discuss them in the context of supporting password
authentication.

 id="x83-1630006.1"></a>Background and Context</h3>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Password reuse is a major threat because it is easy for attackers to compromise many accounts at
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
once. Even if users try to slightly modify their base password, attackers are still able to crack a
large portion of the resulting passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDas2014TangledWeb">67</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XJaeger2016AnalysisOfLeaks">175</a>]</span>. There is mixed evidence about the subset of
passwords that are reused more often, but generally one can identify a “go-to password” for regular
sites, “high-value passwords” for important sites, and a “don’t care” password for the rest
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBailey2014StatisticsReuse">17</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>, <a

href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Password policies were originally designed to combat weak passwords, but some of them try to
steer users away from reused passwords. Usually, this is done through black lists that block
passwords that have already been exposed after a data breach. If a user tried to reuse a password
which has been leaked, the system can detect this and enforce the creation of a new one.
However, Habib et al. showed that users perform predictable alterations to circumvent the
black-list filter <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>]</span>. In total, they identified 13 modification techniques. For instance,
participants in the study added digits, symbols, words or letters. Habib et al. conclude that
blacklists are only useful, if a user’s password modifications are not obviously based on a
blacklisted word. Segreti et al. evaluated a different approach to combat reuse, known as
the “Popularity is Everything” system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSegreti2017AdaptivePolicies">285</a>]</span>. Here, a password becomes blacklisted
after a certain number of users have used the same password. Reuse in this case means
reused by many users, instead of a single individual reusing the credentials multiple
times.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >In most cases, it is impossible to display the full list of blacklisted words in the user interface, so
many service providers cannot do this. Thus, reverse engineering by testing different
passwords is required to draw conclusions on a provider’s policy. Florêncio and Herley
audited policies of public institutions and high-traffic website this way <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">112</a>]</span>. They found
that online retailers have much looser password policies than government or university
sites. Wang and Wang similarly checked the policies of 50 representative websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWang2015EmperorsPolicies">361</a>]</span>
to estimate the resulting entropy of the passwords. They took passwords from leaked
datasets and picked 16 passwords with varying hypothetical strength. Unlike us, they
did not aim to identify black-lists or special forbidden character types. Carnavalet and
Mannan managed to automate dictionary checks by leveraging keep-alive connections <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">48</a>]</span>.
However, they focused on server-side strength estimations rather than blacklists per
se.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Reverse engineering password policies is tedious and might even violate the terms and conditions
of a website. Thus, it would be favorable to compile a repository that contains all policies. This
way, double efforts can be avoided, and service providers could be more transparent by specifying
their own policies. The “policy-repository” would also be useful for a password generator that takes
the site’s policy into account to avoid rejected passwords. In an effort to create such a repository,
Steves et al. proposed to crowd-source the data and defined a formal language (based on XML) to
describe policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSteves2015PasswordPolicyLanguage">313</a>]</span>. The idea was later picked up and extended by Horsch et al.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHorsch2016PasswordPolicyMarkup">166</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >In summary, we conclude that certain policies based on blacklists can help in mitigating password
reuse to some degree. However, blacklists entail usability issues because users have no way of
finding out which passwords are actually on the blacklist of a given website. For our project, this
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
lack of transparency makes it hard to find out and compare policies of different websites, which
demands a careful development of a suitable methodology.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.2    </span> <a 
 id="x83-1640006.2"></a>Method: Reverse-Engineering Password Policies</h3>
<!--l. 40--><p class="noindent" >To create a rich useful data set for studying password policies, we need to address two central
aspects: selecting representative web sites and determining appropriate passwords. The first part is
relatively straight-forward. We took Alexa.com rankings as indicator for the popularity of a
website. To accomplish the analysis in a reasonable time frame, we took the 100 most visited web
sites in Germany, which is 100% more than Wang and Wang, and 33% more than Florêncio and
Herley. As of May 2016, out of these 100 services, 83 allowed public online registrations. The
remaining 17 sites were banks, mobile carriers, or pay-tv providers who require offline registration
and verification as a security measure. The websites and their policies are listed in Table <a 
href="dissch15.html#x133-414002r1">.1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:appendix:policies --></a>
(Appendix). Although we took the most-visited websites in Germany, the results have
implications for an international audience, because many of the audited sites operate
globally.
</p><!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >The second challenge is finding suitable passwords to reverse-engineer password requirements. We
approached this task in two separate stages to find a good candidate set.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x83-1650006.2"></a>First Stage: Identification of Suitable Passwords</h5>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Similar to Wang and Wang, we crafted 15 passwords showing typical password characteristics. The
passwords followed common policy categories as proposed by Shay et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">295</a>]</span>. For instance, some
passwords met a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">3class12 </span>policy by including three different character classes (lower-/uppercase
letters, digits) and a minimum length of 12. Next, we tried to register new accounts with all of these
15 passwords at all 83 websites. In case the site rejected the password, we investigated the reasons
and modified the password until the policy was fulfilled, e.g. by adding or removing characters.
This new password was then added to our test set. During this stage, a number of sites revealed
blacklisted symbols. If this was the case, we intentionally crafted a password with the
blacklisted characters and added it to our set, so that we could see if other websites implicitly
utilize the same blacklist. Similarly, if there were maximum length enforcements, we
added a password longer than that to our list. This process resulted in a test set of <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">46</span>
diverse passwords (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>, Appendix). The list was structured by the following
criteria:

Eleven web sites (13.3%) specifically require at least two different character types (<span

However, ikea.de requires letters and digits, but would not count a symbol towards the two

<span

websites (27.7%) used a dictionary check. Bahn.de demanded three <span

password like <span 
class="ectt-1200">annnna </span>would be rejected, but <span

same character three times in a row, which rejects a couple of German compounds like
<span 
class="ectt-1200">Schifffahrt</span>. Nevertheless, it is easy to find a password that fulfills the complexity requirements
of all 83 websites: “D.ssertation18” is a 4class password that would pass all complexity
requirements.

length greater than nine characters. Among the top 10 most-visited sites, facebook.com, amazon.de,
ebay.de allowed six-character passwords. Security-wise, this is alarming, because even
system-generated 6-character passwords can be brute-forced in a matter of hours in an offline
attack<span class="footnote-mark"><a

 id="x83-169001f2"></a>.
Wikipedia.org, which is also in the top 10, had a minimum length of one character. Interestingly,
two tech-oriented websites allowed the same (heise.de and chip.de). Perhaps the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SP">service providers</a>
expect their technical audience to create stronger passwords anyhow, and they also do not store
much personal information. We were surprised that 40 sites (48.2%) imposed a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">maximum</span>
length restriction, which is counterproductive in terms of password security. The average
maximum length was <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">M </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 43 </span>characters (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">SD </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 32</span>). Ten websites rejected passwords
longer than 20 characters, so a considerable number of passphrases would be excluded
(length(<span 
class="ectt-1200">correcthorsebatterystaple</span>)=25).
</p><!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" >In order to effectively prevent password re-use, the maximum length on one site would need to be
lower than the minimum length of another site. This was not the case in any permutation of policy
pairs. The closest difference was the maximum length at ikea.de (10 characters) and the minimum
length at yahoo.com (9 characters). Thus, only a nine or ten character password can be reused on all
the tested websites. </p><hr class="figure" /><div class="figure"

<!--l. 89--><p class="noindent" >Although the websites at the top of the table, i.e. Google, Facebook, Amazon, all use a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic </span>policy,
there is still a high chance that they reject passwords containing certain characters. We found it was
common to disallow non-ASCII symbols (see Table <a 
href="#x83-170001r1">6.1<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:policies_reuse:black-white-lists --></a>). For instance, Google rejected any
passwords with non-ASCII characters. So, even dictionary words that include letters from
non-English alphabets, e.g. the German umlauts ä,ö, and ü, will be rejected in this case.
Some sites already provide a list of characters that are either allowed or disallowed at
registration time. In the case of mobile.de, the list of allowed symbols is even smaller. On the
positive side of the spectrum, twitter.com accepted even extended Unicode characters like
emojis.
</p><!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >A few websites did not reveal the list of allowed non-ASCII characters; some of our passwords
were blocked if they contained certain characters. Thus, we had to remove character by character to
find out which of them was blacklisted. For regular users, this process would be exceptionally
tedious if their password contained a character from an unknown blacklist. Our audit shows that
spaces and the tilde character ‘~’ are the most likely culprits in this situation, which was
the case at netflix.com, spiegel.de or welt.de. Finally, there were mutually exclusive
policies: Lidl.de proactively shows a list of symbols from which the user has to choose at
least one to create an account. However, all those symbols were disallowed on at least
one other website. In that sense, if a user’s go-to password is immediately accepted at
lidl.de, chances are that it is rejected at a couple of other websites. So, the policy at
lidl.de prevents password reuse, but perhaps at the cost of frustrating users with an exotic
rule.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.4.1    </span> <a 
 id="x83-1720006.4.1"></a>Policies are Mostly Homogenous</h4>
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Overall we can state that in-the-wild policies are largely similar. However, the devil lies in the
details. It is not quite clear why almost half the websites enforce a maximum length restriction,
albeit a high one in most cases. Shorter passwords are easier to guess in an offline attack. It is
therefore almost necessary to lock out users after a number of failed login attempts to at least
mitigate targeted online-guessing (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-480002.2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:attack_vectors --></a>). Blocking non-ASCII characters further
impedes users’ password selection. Although the reasons for doing so are anything but obvious –
allowing more characters increases the theoretical password space and thus potentially security –
we interpret this restriction as a usability precaution. ASCII characters are part of virtually all
physical keyboard layouts, but extended alphabets are not. For instance, if a German user’s
email password were “<span 
class="ectt-1200">Die</span><span 
class="ectt-1200">Ärzte123</span>”, they would be troubled to log into their account
from a PC while abroad, because the umlauts are missing on the keyboard. Of course,
there are ways to enter such characters, but they require much more effort under these
circumstances. The user experience of the entire login process would suffer, which is the
reason for blocking the characters in the first place. However, with the increasing number
of personal mobile devices that also work abroad, the motivation to block non-ASCII
characters crumbles. Artificially blocking non-alphanumeric ASCII symbols, like <span 
class="ectt-1200">$ </span>or
<span 
class="ectt-1200">;</span>, in any case creates unnecessary burden for users. As we have seen in the previous
chapter, users attribute password strength to such symbols and forbidding those can lead to
confusion and erroneous mental models. Perhaps the restriction was introduced to prevent
site vulnerabilities, e.g. SQL injections. But this is a prime example for a misguided
security approach that shifts effort to millions of users rather than to a couple of security
engineers.

<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Neither length, nor complexity requirements were heterogeneous enough to prevent password
reuse. In the end, only artificial character-class restrictions narrowed down the list of
passwords that can be used everywhere. We found that a nine or ten character password
that includes at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit would
have been accepted by 82 of the 83 tested web sites. To circumvent dictionary checks, it
is recommendable to intersperse digits in the middle. Thus, if users pick a password
like <span 
class="ectt-1200">s1lverPWD</span>, current in-the-wild policies do not stand in their way. With an edit
distance of 1, many rejected passwords can be turned into an accepted password if the
rejection was caused by a special character. Hence, the criteria for the most-reusable
password (what we paraphrase with “golden password”) are very well-defined and narrow.
Any password that does not meet these criteria will generate usability issues for users,
e.g. if they try to use longer passwords or ones with a richer character set. Automatic
password generation is hampered in many cases by length limitations. In that sense,
policies help to prevent re-use of “extreme” passwords that are either exceptionally weak
or stronger than average. Reuse of “normal” passwords that work everywhere is not
prevented.
</p><!--l. 106--><p class="noindent" >As a consequence, a policy could be adjusted dynamically if the user signs up with a “golden
password”. It is very likely that a password showing the above described characteristics is reused
across many web sites. As Florêncio et al. pointed out, this is not necessarily a bad thing <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">116</a>]</span>.
However, if a high-value password is reused for an unimportant account, this interference could
lead to problems. Stobert showed that experts are less prone to this threat <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2015ExpertPassword">317</a>]</span>, but regular users
cannot always estimate the importance of an account up front. As a consequence, dynamically
adjusting the policy could be a solution. Alternatively, it might be feasible to more prominently
warn users about reuse and explain the implications. As shown by Ur et al., displaying specific
solutions can help in this situation <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>.

<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" >Our data clearly shows that using software to generate random passwords can become troublesome
for users who opt for this kind of selection support: many policies restrict the length and allowed
characters. Although many password generators enable the users to adjust some parameters of
password creation (like Apple’s system shown in Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>), more effort is required to find the right
parameters. Thus, a system designed to take away cognitive effort becomes effortful once more.
A better solution is to use contextual information for password generation. Typically,
password managers have built-in generators. To avoid that users have to adjust parameters, a
password manager could automatically retrieve the policy for a given website (context) and
generate a strong password that fulfills it. As a proof of concept, we built a web-based
prototype that demonstrates how contextual policy information can be used for password

<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Although the data can be very useful for password generators and for the design of future
composition policies, it is limited in some ways. First, the list of web sites is not comprehensive, we
merely observed a tiny snapshot of the high-traffic websites, which already required days of work
for the entire team. We also could have investigated the top websites in different categories to get
an even more representative sample. However, the current dataset already depicts the state of affairs
in reasonable detail, and is comparable to similar publications <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">112</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWang2015EmperorsPolicies">361</a>]</span>. Furthermore, the longest
password in our test set had a length of 246 characters. We concluded that there is no length
restriction if this password was accepted by a given website, but there might just be a higher
restriction. Nevertheless, since only a fraction of users use passwords this long, this limitation has
almost no consequences.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, for several reasons we did not include emojis in all our tests although they are in fact
part of the unicode character set. First, emojis break some input fields, because most
of them are encoded with 4 bytes instead of 2. This means that they show up as two
characters in the input field, which distorts length requirements. Furthermore, not all
websites were encoded in the extended UTF32 standard and hence failed to submit the
data.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, password policies change over time. Since carrying out our research in May 2016, we
found changes in several of the assessed policies when we randomly re-sampled them.
For instance, idealo.de used to enforce a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">complex </span>policy, but they have switched to a
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic6 </span>as of January 2018. Therefore, our data has a limited lifespan. The big players
on the list, like Facebook, Google, or Amazon, are slower to enforce new polices due
to the even larger user base and business impact. An automated process similar to the
one from Carnavalet and Mannan <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">48</a>]</span> could help continually validate the data in the
future.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.5    </span> <a 
 id="x83-1760006.5"></a>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >In this project, we extensively audited password policies of the top 100
web sites in Germany. The data set is published for further analysis on

 id="x83-176001f4"></a>.
83 of the websites offered public registration, and we could reuse a single password on 82 of them.
Hence, we were able to answer our main research question “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Do password policies prevent</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password reuse?</span>” with a resounding “<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">no</span>”. Thus, we further question the use of strict password
policies as a means to influence password selection. It has been shown that they do not necessarily
lead to stronger passwords. Now we have shown that they also do not prevent reuse. As a
consequence, it would be easier for users if restrictions on password selection were loosened.
Restrictions enforcing a maximum length or a certain set of symbols should be abolished to ensure
universal password generators integrate with the websites. A <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic8 </span>policy appears to work
for the major players, so more service providers can follow them. To account for the
potential security vulnerabilities, blacklisted common passwords and adaptive blacklists
are promising solutions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSegreti2017AdaptivePolicies">285</a>]</span>. Future research should thus evaluate the specific
blacklists and user support to help them find alternatives in case their password was
blacklisted.
