<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Although there are certain general patterns, password selection is a task that each individual
handles in their own way. We have shown in Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a> that password strength is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">subjectively</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">evaluated </span>depending on certain characteristics whose benefits users interpret in different ways.
Again, while there was an overall tendency, we were unable to break down the strength ratings by
such individual differences: was there a special user group who performed better than others in the
game? What characterizes this user group? Moreover, our previous chapter shed light on password
policies in the wild. In a few notable cases, the rules were challenging and reject a substantial part
of passwords. Users have developed strategies to cope with rejected passwords, but it
would be interesting to know the exact factors that contribute to their behavior in these
circumstances. Egelman and Peer make a strong argument that there is no “average
user” so it is necessary to look at individual differences to understand user behavior
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2015AverageUser">98</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Demographic background is one of the external factors that influences password selection
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XViolettas2014PasswordsAvoidGreece">351</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWang2015ChinesePWs">359</a>]</span>. Personality traits have been brought into the discussion to explain user
preferences, actions, and behaviors in security questions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrown2004GeneratingPWs">42</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XGross2016EffectCognitiveEffort">143</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShropshire2006PersonalityITSec">304</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XZakaria2013DesigningEffectiveSecurityMessages">387</a>]</span>. Especially in
research about phishing susceptibility we find evidence that personality traits have the potential to
explain behavior <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHalevi2013PilotStudyPersonality">148</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XHalevi2015SpearPhishing">149</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XParrishJr2009PersonalityPhishing">252</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUebelacker2014SocialEngineering">339</a>]</span>. Empirical results from password studies have been
discussed and explained with different personality traits, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword">153</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">368</a>]</span>. It is evident that a
user’s personality shines through when they select a word with personal meaning. Petrie
classified users in distinct password personalities: family-oriented, fans, fantasists, and
cryptics<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss89.html#fn1x24"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x88-178001f1"></a>.
A LastPass report more roughly divides password usage into two groups <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked">208</a>]</span>: Type A users want
to stay in control and are driven to act securely, so they developed an elaborate system that they
perceive as suitable. Type B users do not believe that their accounts are valuable to attackers, so
they do not prioritize security over usability. Those two taxonomies stem from analysis of
user-selected passwords, i.e. a retrospective evaluation. However, predictive approaches are
under-explored. For instance, if a user is generally an emotional person, does this impact their
password selection strategies? If a user is diligent in real life, do they invest effort to diligently craft
passwords, too?
</p><!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >In a series of user studies we explored the associations between personality traits and passwords. If
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
such associations exist, they open a new range of support systems that are tailored to a user’s
personality. Current one-fits-all approaches could be re-designed radically. The research was
carried out in cooperation with three students. In each separate project we focused on a different
stage of the password life-cycle. Timo Erdelt investigated personality as predictor for the usability
of composition policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XErdelt2017BA">101</a>]</span>. Paul Huber explored correlations between strength perceptions and
personality traits <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuber2016BA">168</a>]</span>. Finally, Aline Neumann examined personality factors in password selection
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XNeumann2017BA">241</a>]</span>. In total, 440 individuals participated in three separate online studies. In the following
sections, the projects are put into context and their findings are discussed on a bigger
picture.

<h5 class="likesubsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x88-1790007"></a>Research Objectives</h5>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Our primary goal was to find ways to predict password behavior from personality traits. At this
point, the discourse about risky passwords included personality factors as hypothetical explanatory
variables. However, only few empirical studies had been carried out to challenge the assumptions.
We aimed to provide such empirical data and a discussion of the implications on the design of
password policies and password authentication systems. For instance, adjusting requirements of
password policies depending on the user’s personality promises to reduce frustration of password
selection. Thus, our over-arching research question can be framed as “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Does personality influence</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">a user’s mental models of password strength and consequently selection and coping</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strategies?</span>”.

<!--l. 42--><p class="noindent" >In this section we give a brief overview about the characteristics of strong passwords and how users
go about creating them. Moreover, we portray projects in usable security and privacy research in
which the users’ psyche has been the focus.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x88-1810007.1.1"></a>Sociodemographic and Cognitive Factors</h4>
<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >Apart from such conscious behavior, there may be other preconditions that make some users pick
stronger passwords than others. In a large field study, Mazurek et al. found that computer science
and engineering students created passwords that were less guessable than those from business or
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
politics students <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>. Beyond demographic background, context factors like the emotional state
during password selection have also been investigated. Gulenko examined the effect of presenting
positive textual messages and icons during password selection and found benefits for the
adoption of passphrases <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGulenko2014PasswordsEmotion">144</a>]</span>. In contrast, putting users in a state of cognitive distress or
depletion made participants choose weaker passwords in a large lab study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGross2016EffectCognitiveEffort">143</a>]</span>. Social
pressure as another type of psychological leverage was investigated by Egelman et al.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>. While they argue that account value plays a superior role for the effectiveness of
password meters, others have shown that the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">design </span>of a password meter does have a
measurable impact on the effort users put into creating a password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>]</span>. In summary, the
literature shows that password selection depends on context factors beyond education and
experience.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x88-1820007.1.2"></a>Personality Factors in Cyber Security</h4>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >In our work, we are interested in context factors of password strength originating from
psychological variables like personality. One of the most commonly used models to characterize
personality are the Big-Five traits (B5), also known as the five-factor model. Costa and McCrae
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCosta1992NEO">60</a>]</span> refer to the personality traits as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">openness to experience</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">conscientiousness</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">extraversion</span>,
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">agreeableness</span>, and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">neuroticism </span>(OCEAN). The traits can be described with these exemplary
adjectives <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMcCrae1987ValidationFFM">229</a>]</span>:<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Openness: </span>imaginative, creative, curious, independent, liberal<br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Conscientiousness: </span>careful, reliable, ambitious, scrupulous, neat, punctual<br

class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Neuroticism: </span>worrying, emotional, insecure, impatient, vulnerable, subjective
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Most frequently, the influence of these personality traits have been explored for privacy-concerns,
where the openness trait was associated with privacy attitudes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2015PredictingAttitudes">96</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XMinkus2014PersonalizationPrivacy">235</a>]</span>. Other inquiries have
shown that personality traits like neuroticism <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHalevi2013PilotStudyPersonality">148</a>]</span> or openness <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUebelacker2014SocialEngineering">339</a>]</span> might be associated with the
response to phishing attacks. The likelihood of employees adhering to security policies
is potentially influenced by the manifestation of agreeableness and conscientiousness
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShropshire2006PersonalityITSec">304</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShropshire2015">305</a>]</span>. These investigations show that personality models are a considerable factor in
security and privacy. Yet, our understanding of the influence of personality on password
perception and consequently password selection is still low. Our work tries to improve
our understanding about the origin of the differences in users’ judgments of password
strength.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.2    </span> <a 
 id="x88-1830007.2"></a>Study 1: Policies</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >We start out with the exploration of psychological factors for the design of password policies. We
were motivated by the fact that, at this point, policies are a one-fits-all solution that evidently does
not work in the same ways for all users: Shay et al. observed that subjective usability ratings for
policies differed among participants <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">297</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>. For instance, about 40% of their participants found
it difficult to create a password under a “3class16” policy, but another 40% found it easy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>.
Following the general discourse and related results from privacy research, we hypothesized that an
individual’s personality might be responsible for their attitudes towards one policy or
another. Therefore, our goal in this project was to explore such associations between
personality traits and policy preference. At this point, we leave out analyses on password
strength.
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x88-1840007.2.1"></a>Method</h4>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Our study was completely exploratory, because the literature did not allow us to derive narrow
hypotheses. Since personality traits are nuanced, we opted for an online survey to collect a large
sample. Personality was assessed based on the Five-Factor Model. We opted for the very reliable
BFI-K construct by Rammstedt and John <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRammstedt2005BFI">261</a>]</span>, which is also freely available in German.
Moreover, with its 21 items, the time to fill out the questionnaire is kept reasonably low.
Participants were asked to create several passwords in a row, i.e. the study followed a
within-groups protocol. Here, we evaluated three different password policies: a traditional
(3class12), an uncommon (2word12), and a novel policy (emoji12) that required the
selection of at least one emoji through a graphical user interface (more on emojis in Chapter
<a 
href="dissch11.html#x110-33200011">11<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:emojipasswords --></a>). The reason for this choice was that the policies are different enough to serve as
characteristic levels of the independent variable “policy”. Also, creating passwords that
exceed the length requirements of typical policies (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch6.html#x83-1610006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:policies_reuse --></a>) is more difficult, so we
could better measure the differences of perceived difficulty. Participants assessed the
“difficulty to create” of a password for each policy. Moreover, we had them rank the
policies by their personal preference, so the distinctiveness of 3class12, 2word12, and
emoji12 would help them spot and judge the differences easily, which makes the data more
reliable.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x88-1850007.2.1"></a>Structure and Tasks</h5>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The study was divided into 3 overall parts. In the first part, participants were briefed about privacy
details of the study and they provided demographic background information. Then they proceeded
to the personality questionnaire before they were asked to perform three experimental tasks. Each
consisted of creating a password and assessing the difficulty with agreement levels on the three
items <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“It was difficult to create a password that meets the requirements”</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“I found the password</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">requirements bothersome”</span>, and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“It was easy to create a new password”</span>. Agreement was measured
on a five-point scale ranging from “Strongly disagree” to “Strongly agree”. Inversely keying the
items as well double encoding makes the data more robust against implausible responses. The
resulting difficulty-to-create score thus ranges from 3 to 15 (3 = very easy, 15 = very
difficult).
</p><!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >The order of the policies was counterbalanced during the experiment to mitigate order effects. For
each participant, we recorded the resulting order as a control variable. We chose an
online-banking scenario for all three selection tasks. The first prompt was to create a
password to protect an online banking account. Secondly, participants were told that
someone had gained access to their account and the bank locked them out. As a security
precaution, they had to reset their first password. The last task description explained that their
password had expired after one year and they need to reset it again. This storyline was
designed to fulfill the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">realistic threat </span>principle proposed by Krol et al. (see Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-810003.1.1">3.1.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:principles-experiments --></a>)
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">205</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >We used SosciSurvey, a standard survey tool, to collect the responses. The dynamic parts involving
password selection were embedded in iframes. To match the data from the survey tool and the
iframe we used URL query parameters containing the response ID. We asked participants to
only use a desktop browser to avoid styling glitches and unexpected behavior from the
prototypes.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x88-1860007.2.1"></a>Recruiting and Demographic Background</h5>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >We recruited participants through posts on social networks and by sending out the invitation link in
a university-wide newsletter (more than 5000 recipients), which was due to time and budget
constraints. To incentivize participation, we announced a raffle of five shopping vouchers with a
value of 20<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-120">€ </span>each. At this point, 222 people had started participation. After drop-out and
plausibility checks, the remaining sample size was <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">N </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 164</span>. As expected, the age distribution
was narrow: our sample consisted mostly of students in their mid-twenties (average
age 24 (SD=5). 79 respondents were female, 83 male, and 2 preferred not to answer.
In the background screener, 65 people (40%) indicated to possess formal training in
computer science or information technology. We also requested self-reported assessments on
password practices. Here we found that 40% reuse passwords without modification,
32% reuse them with modifications or with a mnemnoic technique. 17% often create
new passwords. In terms of management strategy, the majority (53%) tries to memorize
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
passwords. 11% use a password manager or generator. Written cues served as aid for 10% of
respondents, and 16% write passwords down on analog media, while 21% use electronic
files.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x88-1870007.2.1"></a>Statistical Analyses</h5>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >For  statistical  analyses,  we  consulted  the
StabLab<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss90.html#fn2x24"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x88-187001f2"></a>
to identify suitable methods. After a revision of the collected data and the necessary assumption
checks, we analyzed associations by fitting <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:GAM">generalized additive models (GAMs)</a> to the
dataset. Their advantage over linear regression is that they are more flexible for non-linear
associations<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss91.html#fn3x24"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x88-187002f3"></a>.
The <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mgcv </span>package for R was used to calculate the models. GAMs can be primarily interpreted
through residual/smooth plots – the steeper the fitted regression line, the stronger the
association (The box in the results section (<a

assessed with four items each. The agreement level for every item was mapped to numeric values
from 1 to 5. The score on each sub-dimension is the sum of agreement levels. To better
estimate effect sizes, we control for gender, age and IT proficiency in the regression
models.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x88-1880007.2.1"></a>Method Limitations</h5>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >The method, albeit carefully executed, faces a few limitations regarding the interpretability of the
data. First, the sample was fairly homogeneous, because participants were mostly between 20 and
28 years old and have an academic background. This might reduce statistical power in detecting
effects on personality <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSrivastava2003PersonalityAdulthood">310</a>]</span>, but on the other hand, this constellation resolves age-related
confounding effects. Moreover, our study was strongly focused on individual preferences and
usability perceptions of different policies, so only a within-groups design was feasible. However, in
real-life password selection, users rarely select three passwords in a row. The choice of our
storyline still makes us confident about the ecological validity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">103</a>]</span>. The repeated measures design
did not allow us to measure the policies’ influence on password memorability, which we have to
postpone to another study. At this stage, the subjective preference was more valuable for our
exploration than memorability effects. Besides, we briefed participants to fill out the survey on a
desktop PC or a similar device. Since it is always possible to circumvent user-agent
detection by requesting the desktop version, we cannot guarantee that all participants
followed this instruction, which might have had an effect on their password selection
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Finally, we unfortunately made a mistake in the deployment of the emoji-based policy. Instead of
12 characters, it required participants to select 16 characters beside the emoji. We realized this fact
by looking at descriptive statistics during the course of the study, because the policy
performed significantly worse than the other two. We re-deployed the emoji-based policy
immediately after we had realized the error. Consequently, we had to remove the data for
the creation difficulty and ranking in cases 1-61, reducing the overall sample size to
103. Nonetheless, the sample size is sufficiently large to investigate medium to strong
effects.

The GAM allowed us to model associations linearly for the control variables (example for emoj12
in Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). Although we have to be careful not to generalize too strongly with our
sample, linear associations at least enable us to use correlation coefficients <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B </span>as basis for
discussion. Female participants assessed it slightly more difficult to create passwords
under the emoji12 (<span

uncommon in the wild and ignores the verdict of high complexity – IT people might be
skeptical about the “words” requirement, while others are less concerned about it. The task
order also showed medium-strong influence on creation difficulty. If emoji12 or 3class12

Contrarily to the modeling functions for control variables, we mostly observed non-linear
associations between trait scores and creation difficulty (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). One exception is the weak
linear association in the emoji12 (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">B </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">−</span><span

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">22</span>) condition. It tells us that it was slightly easier to
create emoji-passwords for people with higher neuroticism scores. The neuroticism trait is also
referred to as “emotional stability” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCosta1992NEO">60</a>]</span>, i.e. neurotic people are usually more emotional.
Expressing <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">emotions </span>with emojis in passwords seems to support this trait and come easier to users
scoring high on neuroticism.
</p><!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >In the models for the 2word12 policy, all associations were non-linear and thus inconclusive at this
point. For the 3class12 policy, associations were linear but trivial for the extraversion,
conscientiousness, and neuroticism factors. In summary, scores of the “Creation Difficulty”
scale are difficult to explain with personality traits, but control variables appear to have
stronger influence. Only neuroticism is associated notably with difficulty to create an
emoji-password.

preferred the 3class12 policy (68%). The emoji policy was best ranked by 18 participants, and
2word12 by 12 participants. Using logistic additive regression, we can determine the factors that
contribute to these preferences. In essence, the model gives us the likelihood of voting a
given policy to the top, which is a binary decision (1 = preferred, 0 = not preferred).

significantly less time to select passwords for the second and third tasks (example shown
in <span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x88-1970007.2.3"></a>Finding Summary</h4>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >Overall, the usability metrics were comparable for all policies and the ranking was fairly
homogeneous. So, any deviance from the mean could potentially be explained by personality traits
and other confounding factors. In terms of personality, the most important finding was that scores
on the neuroticism dimension seem to be positively associated with the usability of the
emoji policy. As indicated above, emojis in passwords appear to fulfill their purpose
in that they help some people express their emotions. Participants who did not have a
background in IT were much more likely to prefer the emoji policy, and their neuroticism score
played a subordinate role. Perhaps, a lack of expertise does not allow those participants to
consider the switch from keyboard to mouse and vice versa (<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">homing</span>). Moreover, the
3class12 policy received the most votes which might be due to the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">status quo bias </span>or
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">familiarity bias</span>. 3class12 is the only commonplace policy among the tested ones, so
participants were already used to it and voted it first. The timings were mostly affected by
the task order – participants spent less time on the second and third creation task. So
although personality traits serve as predictors for timings, these effects were weaker by
comparison.
</p><!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >In summary, control factors had a greater effect on password usability and approval of policies than
personality traits. Nonetheless, medium to strong effects are more likely to be detected with
our sample size to begin with. So, the fact that we even observed small associations
indicates that personality is a contributing factor to the perception of password policies. At
this stage of the research we were not able to look into the selection behavior because
the repeated measures design stood in the way. Thus, we designed and conducted two
further studies to investigate the effect of personality on password strength perception and
selection.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.3    </span> <a 
 id="x88-1980007.3"></a>Study 2: Strength Perceptions</h3>
<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >With an observational online study, we explored the associations between psychological variables
and password strength perception. As outlined in Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>, we regard the perception of strength as
an implicit driver for behavior, which is more difficult to observe. Hence, we explored associations
between subjective password strength ratings and scores on well-established psychometric scales.
The task resembled the PASDJO game: participants were shown a password, and they had to rate it
on a seven-point scale. We chose seven point scales to make the approach more comparable to Ur et
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. Moreover, we gave participants two passwords, and they had to decide which one was
stronger.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Before we ran the study, we pre-registered the experiment with the open-science framework
(OSF)<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss92.html#fn4x24"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x88-198001f4"></a>
and planned to conduct all analyses as predicted to mitigate confirmation bias. However, the
envisioned statistical tests were not always applicable, which forced us to consider more
appropriate methods and move away from the pre-registration. Since we consider our research
efforts mostly exploratory, we approached the study without specific hypotheses regarding the
influence of certain personality traits on the perception of password strength.

parts, to give the reader the full picture about the participants’ tasks. However, we have to omit a

The second part elicited characteristics about the passwords that our participants used on real
online accounts. Here, we asked about typical password attributes, like LUDS (lower-, uppercase,
digits, symbols), length and the inclusion of dictionary words. The collection of such password
descriptions is an ethically reasonable way to study actual behavior that does not directly involve
creating and disclosing an entire password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">354</a>]</span>. Participants could select from a list of accounts
that they used on a regular basis, e.g. Facebook, YouTube, Netflix, Google. If they did not have
any of the selectable accounts they could provide another. We call the description of a
participant’s password on any of these sites “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">meta password</span>” in the remainder of the
chapter. We included this part in the survey to explore additional covariates for strength

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Standalone Strength Rating</span></span>
In the third part of the study, the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">rating part</span>, the participants assessed the strength of one password
at a time in random order, similar to playing PASDJO. The passwords had to be rated on 7-point
scales ranging from <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">1 = very weak </span>to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">7 = very strong</span>. We picked a set that was comparable to
related work <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span> and that we carefully designed around certain attributes. Table <a 
href="#x88-200001r3">7.3<!--tex4ht:ref: tab:password-list --></a> shows the
selected set of passwords and their features. The “length” category distinguishes between short
passwords with nine characters or less and long passwords with ten characters or more. The
distinction is inspired by real-world policies that most commonly require up to nine characters (see
Chapter <a 
href="dissch6.html#x83-1610006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:policies_reuse --></a>). The “strength” category groups passwords on three levels by their guess number
as determined by zxcvbn. Weak passwords require less than <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">6</span> guessing attempts,
strong passwords at least <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">12</span> guesses, and medium passwords anything in between. This
classification is in concordance with related work <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014AdministratorsGuide">115</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">369</a>]</span> . To fully counterbalance all
category combinations, one would require 120 items, which we could not implement for the
sake of brevity. Hence, we kept the number of items small to mitigate fatigue during the
study sessions. In the chosen set of 13 passwords, there were at least three items for
each distinct category, i.e. three short, long, weak and strong passwords, and at least
three passwords pertaining to different LUDS policies (lowercase, uppercase, digits and
symbols).

Following a similar procedure as Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>, participants moved on to compare the strength of
passwords pairs (<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">comparsion part</span>). The 7-point scale ranged from “&#x003C;left password&#x003E; is much
stronger” to “&#x003C;right password&#x003E; is much stronger”. The pairs were constructed such that the
passwords differed, e.g., in the existence and positions of digits and uppercase letters. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>
illustrates our scoring schema.

received hints that it would have been better to include a gap of a couple of days before
collecting the SeBIS data to ensure its validity. Doing so would mitigate priming and social
desirability biases. Since we failed to take this into account beforehand, we do not report the
results further, but it is important to mention that the questionnaire included those 16

The study concluded with two psychometric tests. In the <span

the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP), which is a representation of Costa and McCrae’s NEO-PI-R
domains <span class="cite">[<a

In this personality test, participants rate how accurately a certain statement portraying a certain
personality characteristic describes themselves. Each item is a 5-point scale with the labels <span

<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">inaccurate, moderately inaccurate, neither accurate nor inaccurate, moderately accurate, very</span>
<span

was shown that the 50-item version of the test shows high correlation with more exhaustive tests

<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Since at least three passwords showed a certain characteristic, e.g. uppercase letters, we averaged
the ratings for them accordingly and used them as dependent variables. Moreover, in
the psychometric tests we accounted for negatively keyed items, i.e. those items that
were phrased with negations like <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“I don’t talk a lot”</span>. We inverted the ratings where
necessary and afterwards calculated the sum of agreement levels for each dimension (<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">trait</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">score</span>).
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >As in Section <a 
href="#x88-1830007.2">7.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:personality:study-1 --></a>, we repeatedly fit a <a

regression<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss94.html#fn6x24"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x88-206001f6"></a>.
Subjective password strength assessments, respectively comparisons, serve as dependent/response
variables. We calculate one score per participant and password category by adding up
the corresponding ratings. For instance, if they rated all eight passwords containing
digits with seven points, their score for “G_Digits” (<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">G</span>roup of passwords with digits)
is 56. We average participants’ ratings for models that require means instead of total
scores.
</p><!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >Psychometric scores on all several sub-dimensions served as independent variables (covariates). We
always control the regression models for gender, technical background and age to contrast
effects. Wherever possible, we model covariates as linear, if the GAM indicates that
smoothing is unnecessary. For this data-set, we also conducted principal component analysis
followed by factor analysis. The resulting factors are then used to fit additional models for
comparison. This allows us to evaluate the suitability of the Big Five inventory for our
exploration.

respondents approached the rating task. They could enter free-text answers after all ratings were
done. The answers were then coded independently by two members of the team. The first coding
step was to find categories and propose the code book. Afterwards, the proposed codes were
handed over to the second coder, who sorted answers into the categories and amended new ones
where necessary. Interrater agreement between the two coders was satisfactory (78%,

can thus be considered ethically acceptable.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.3.6    </span> <a 
 id="x88-2100007.3.6"></a>Limitations</h4>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >Like most studies involving personality assessment, the result is only a rough model of a person’s
personality and does not include all facets. We chose a test with 50 items to assess the Big-Five
traits. While such psychometric tests exist with item counts between 10 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGosling2003TIPI">137</a>]</span> and 240 items <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCosta1992NEO">60</a>]</span>,
the 50-item version has high internal reliability and does not fatigue the respondents as
much as more exhaustive tests. Additionally, with a sample size of 100 participants,
power-analysis tells us, that only strong and medium interactions are likely to be found for
with our regression models (cf. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShevlin1998SampleSize">303</a>]</span> or <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XField2005DiscoveringStatistics">108</a>, p. 223]</span>). At this stage of the exploration,
however, this is what we aimed for. If we do find effects with such a small sample, then they
must be large enough to justify follow-up investigations with larger samples. Moreover,
statistical analyses can be done very differently. We traded off model complexity and
interpretability to draw first conclusions. Thus, the reported associations can never be seen <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">causal</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">effects</span>, because we would have to use different experimental setups, and carry out the
experiments many times on larger samples. In the scope of our personality studies, we
therefore provide pointers and possible explanations, but do not claim that the results are
highly generalizable. This is especially important, because the sample stems from a
technically savvy audience. Users registering for tools like Prolific or Amazon Mechanical
Turk may also have stronger financial motivation to do so than the rest of the population
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRoss2010WhoAreTurkers">271</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, the methodology relies on self-assessment and honest answers, which are difficult to
control. We introduced an attention check to mitigate the problem, by asking people to compare
two identical passwords. For the meta-password, we do not know whether it was created on a
mobile or desktop device. Passwords created on mobiles are usually less complex than those
created on desktops <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2014HoneyIShrunkTheKeys">355</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 83--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the study set-up and procedure may also influence the interpretability of the outcome. We
decided not to randomize the order of the question blocks to maintain full control over the general
procedure. When we measure dependent variables, the order of questions is still randomized in the
question groups. This way, the potential fatigue effects are the same for all participants at the
different stages, while the important questions are in random order. Moreover, the items for
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
password pairs were not fully counterbalanced on all levels to prevent fatigue when answering
the entire questionnaire. A more exhaustive set of tested passwords would increase the
generalizability.

For overall strength rating, most covariates revealed linear associations (Table <span

password” categories. The highest model fit was achieved for the “Passphrase” category
(<span

responsible for the overall strength rating model. In summary, personality did not explain
much of the participants’ assessment. Penalizing smoothing parameters in stronger ways
achieved higher model fits, however, the likelihood of overfitting the models increases.
Therefore, we explored different factor constellations to get closer to explaining strength
perceptions.

Although the IPIP scale showed good internal consistency, we can try to break down the
contributing factors. Usually, a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Principal Component Analysis </span>(PCA) reduces the number of
factors, but does not have to. In our case, we would expect five distinct factors from the 50 items,
but a PCA revealed that there might be <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">ten </span>for our data set. We thus extracted those factors with
a standard factor analysis using varimax rotation and used these factors as predictors
instead of the big-five trait scores. The resulting model explained a larger portion of the
deviance (20.1% vs. 14.7%) for overall assessment, but the R-square value remained
constant. Coefficients for Factor 3 were biggest (<span

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= </span><span

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">21</span>), and all items of
the openness sub-scale loaded onto it. To a much smaller degree, conscientiousness,
agreeableness, and extraversion items also formed this factor. As a consequence, marginal effects,
i.e. caused by only one personality trait, can be ruled out – it is a combination of trait
scores that explains associations in our model. However, only a confirmatory study with a
larger sample size can deliver final answers as to the specific trait combinations. As of
now, we hypothesize that participants showing particular constellations of openness,
conscientiousness and extraversion scores rated all passwords lower than other participants.

The mixed model is strongly influenced by interaction terms with predictable character
substitutions. In general, more digits, uppercase letters, and symbols led to higher strength ratings,
but this association was strongly reversed if digits or symbols acted as l33t substitutions. Thus, we
conclude that respondents were skeptical about this password creation strategy in the rating part.
By and large, personality was a minor factor.

<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >Entering an elaborate response to justify judgments was not mandatory. Yet, all but one participant
(<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">n</span>=99) gave a brief and in most cases comprehensible explanation for their ratings. The
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
following numbers do not necessarily add up to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">n</span>, because an answer could contain multiple
codes.
</p><!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >We identified four overall themes in how the participants approached rating passwords: <span

<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">diversity</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">creation strategy</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">predictability </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">other</span>. The character diversity code consists of
participants mentioning the importance of symbols (69), digits (52), upper-/lowercase letters (45)
and general variety of characters (16). Regarding the creation strategy, many participants penalized
passwords when they contained actual words (40) or personal information (3). The predictability
category was divided into answers referring to character substitutions (10), patterns (17),
guessability (12), randomness (20), length (25) and the position of symbols/digits (6). The other
themes were established from 8 participants using technical jargon (e.g. “attack” or “brute force”)
and those who identified the obfuscated passwords (2). These themes echo the quantitative ratings
very well.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.3.8    </span> <a 
 id="x88-2220007.3.8"></a>Finding Summary</h4>
<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" >We found that participants evaluate password strength by looking for specific patterns. Regression
models and qualitative analysis show that respondents mostly penalized lack of diversity and
randomness which is consistent with related work <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. Thus, the associations originating
from different personality traits were small in many cases, but not negligible. Technical
background and gender played a role in the comparison task, because male participants were
more likely influenced by character diversity. On aggregate, the predictive power of the
independent variables was higher in the comparison task than in the standalone rating.
Nonetheless, a fine-grained mixed model revealed interesting side effects for standalone
ratings. These include the reversal of the correlation if a digit or symbol was used to
substitute a letter. The most important personality factors across both tasks were <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">openness</span>,
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">agreeableness </span>and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">conscientiousness</span>. The sample size might have been too small to yield
narrow confidence intervals and impressive model fits. As exploratory stage, however,
the data provides considerable evidence as to the feasibility of investigating “password
personality”.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >As a final step in our “password personality” exploration, we ran another online study. Having
investigated policies and the perception of passwords through the lens of personality traits, the main
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
goal of the third study was to evaluate potential associations between personality and password
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">selection</span>. To overcome some of the limitations of the previous study, we hoped to increase the
sample size and reduce the number of items during the study. Moreover, further answers about the
participants’ explanations and motivations were considered to better understand the weight of
personality factors. We determined the following research questions: 1) Are there correlations
between password features (topology) and personality traits? 2) Do certain facets of
personality shine through in password coping strategies, e.g. the tendency to write down
passwords?

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.4.1    </span> <a 
 id="x88-2240007.4.1"></a>Procedure and Tools</h4>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >The study was designed to take no more than ten minutes to lower the friction for participation. The
briefing page informed participants about the purpose of the study and data disclosure policies.
After acknowledging the conditions of participation, respondents were asked to create a password.
To boost ecological validity, we provided a fictitious but realistic scenario <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>. The task was to
come up with a new password for a new email account that they were going to use as their main
address. Further, the instruction pointed out that the incentive would only be paid of if the
participants chose a password they could recall later on. A <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic8 </span>policy was enforced,
as it is one of the most representative policies in the wild (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch6.html#x83-1610006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:policies_reuse --></a>). This loose
policy would also allow for both very complex and rather simple passwords, which
could be associated with personality traits. Having successfully confirmed the password,
respondents were taken to a questionnaire about demographics, just like in the first two
studies.
</p><!--l. 9--><p class="noindent" >Next, participants completed the BFI-K questionnaire consisting of 21 items that have to be rated
on a 5-point scale. We opted not to use the 50-item inventory for the sake of saving time. We added
an item that served as an attention check. It asked to respond to this item with “disagree”. Failure to
follow this instruction allowed us to drop the response from the dataset. The resulting 22 items
were shuffled to avoid sequence effects.
</p><!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >Afterwards, we surveyed respondents about their password management behaviors and
preferences. We used multiple-choice and open responses to collect qualitative, self-reported
data. For instance, we wanted to know how they cope with multiple accounts or how
they reuse passwords. Since the study was done as part of a bachelor thesis project, we
were limited by the amount of time available. Therefore, we deemed the self-assessment
sufficient to gauge security behavior rather than taking more time to administer a SeBIS
questionnaire. The survey concluded with a recall task, where participants provided their initially
chosen password. They could try as often as they liked, and the number of attempts
were recorded. In case they were unable to recall their password, they could proceed
anyhow and take part in the lottery. If they chose to provide an email address in the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
final step, this data was stored separately from the questionnaire data to avoid privacy
issues.

<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >Participants were invited via a university newsletter, and snowballing the link via personal
connections and posts on social networks. The questionnaire was in German and participants were
screened about their command of the German language. We instructed participants to take the
survey on a desktop. 184 people completed the survey, but we had to drop the responses of 8
participants because their response timings were unrealistically fast (lower than 2 * standard
deviation). From the 176 remaining respondents, 89 were male, 86 female and 1 preferred
not to answer. 116 were students, i.e. a rather high proportion (66%). Consequently,
the average age was 25 years (range [16;55], <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">SD </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 6</span>, <span

had an IT-background. 129 respondents chose to participate in the raffle for shopping
vouchers.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.4.3    </span> <a 
 id="x88-2260007.4.3"></a>Limitations</h4>
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >Like most password-selection studies, our study is limited by the purposefulness of the task:
Participants knew they were only going to use the password in the study. To mitigate this, we tried
to give participants enough context information to immerse themselves into the situation.
Moreover, while the study was ongoing, we received 30 feedback emails asking for clarification
about the attention check questions. We had introduced an additional item at a random position in
the personality construct. This led to misunderstandings that we failed to identify in the design and
piloting of the survey. Some respondents thought that this question was a measure of their
personality, too, and indicated giving a wrong answer on purpose. We therefore had to omit this
sanity check entirely, because it did not feasibly tell whether participants had read the
questions carefully enough. Instead, we based the decisions to drop responses on the
timings.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.4.4    </span> <a 
 id="x88-2270007.4.4"></a>Results</h4>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >The resulting 176 passwords had a median-length of 10 characters (range [8;22]) – 130 participants
went beyond the minimum requirement of eight characters. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> visualizes additional metrics
that show that passwords were also stronger than expected with a mean guess number greater than
<span

href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014AdministratorsGuide">115</a>]</span>.
Moreover, overall internal consistency of the big-five construct was at <span

the bar at 0.7. Subscales for each trait, however, were more consistent and above the threshold. In
the following, we try to fit generalized additive models to the data using B5 trait scores as
covariates.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >First, we use zxcvbn metrics as response variables (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>), and explore marginal
associations with big five traits. As before, we include age, gender and IT-background as control
covariates. We found that only password length was (significantly) associated with B5-traits:
Participants with higher <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">neuroticism </span>scores tended to create longer passwords (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">β </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">21</span>), using
more lower-case letters as a side effect (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">β </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">19</span>). A second corollary was that passwords from
those participants also consisted of more word-chunks (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">β </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">26</span>). However, it is hard to read this
result, because even very long random passwords consist of only one matching sequence
(“bruteforce”), so more chunks does not imply greater strength. Moreover, having an IT
background was positively associated with password length (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">β </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">21</span>). A one-tailed
Mann-Whitney test confirms this (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">W </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 4204</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">p</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x003C;</span> 0.05). Consequently, password guess
numbers were higher if participants had an IT background (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">β </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 0</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">.</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">19</span>). None of the models
however, achieved exceptionally good fit: the maximum R-squared (adjusted) value was
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">R</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-90">adj</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">=</span> 0.13 (for the number of symbols as target variable). We tried to achieve a better fit by
performing a principal component and factor analyses. This was not effective, either.
We conclude that password metrics are only very slightly predictable by personality
profiles.

<!--l. 43--><p class="noindent" >We manually coded all passwords in two stages: first we tagged passwords with a creation
strategy and afterwards we combined them to broader categories. The resulting codes for
passwords and their respective frequencies were: simple (17), systematic (7), random
(16), mnemonic (8), passphrase (25), common-topology (56), and hardened-topology
(47). <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Simple </span>passwords can be found in dictionaries, consist of only one word, only
lowercase letters or only digits. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Systematic </span>passwords are assembled with keyboard
patterns. We did not see any coherent approach in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">random </span>passwords. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Mnemonic </span>passwords
have upper- and lower-case letters, digits and punctuation at predictable positions that
indicate a sentence-like structure as origin. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Passphrases </span>are combinations of dictionary
words with or without separators. The <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">common-topology </span>code describes passwords with
more than one character class that show typical password structures like “hello123”
or “Banana1!”. Finally, <span

pseudo-random capitalization of letters, but clearly come from a common-topology
password.

notes on paper or a file (<span

</p><!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >We created generalized additive logit models for every management strategy, i.e. binary outcomes
like “Using a password manager”: 1 (true) or 0 (false). Since the percentage of participants reusing
passwords is so high, influence by personality traits was unlikely to be detected. Consequently,
none of the associations was flagged as significant for reuse. However, older participants were more
likely to reuse passwords as shown in Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>. Extroverted participants were significantly less
likely to write passwords down on paper or into a digital file (<span

<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >Only 18 out of 176 participants (10%) failed to recall the newly created password at the
end of the survey. Thus, associations with personality traits were unlikely. However, it
was clear even with only 18 passwords being forgotten that the length of the password
significantly contributed to failure rates (<span

as predictors (<span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x003C;</span> 0.05). Thus, password
memorability was associated with personality, but we are not able to tell exactly in which
way.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.4.5    </span> <a 
 id="x88-2320007.4.5"></a>Summary and Interpretation</h4>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >We observed that password length was marginally associated with neuroticism, but none of the
other personality traits. Higher neuroticism scores can be paraphrased as lower emotional stability.
Losing access to an account might lead to stronger emotional reactions. So, possibly, participants
showing this trait want to make sure that this scenario does not happen by choosing a
longer and stronger password. Participants working in or studying an IT-related field,
were also more likely to pick longer passwords, but achieved significantly higher guess
numbers. This corroborates findings from Mazurek et al. conclusively <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>. Fitting
generalized additive models to data of 176 participants did not show sufficiently strong model
fits to warrant definite inferences about the influence of personality traits on password
metrics. To a higher degree of certainty, however, we can state that personality must not be
ruled out for password selection, which is an unprecedented result. This finding was
particularly evident when we dropped the big five scores as predictors for memorizing the
password.
</p><!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >Regarding the retrospective data, we also found salient associations. Although the overall sample
shows that using a password manager is unattractive, a deeper analysis revealed that the
participants’ age and openness scores are linked to using a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>, or to memorization efforts. These
predictors were inversely associated, which means that there could be a “sweet spot” of openness
scores and age. Consequently, this gives us the opportunity to segment target groups for password
managers more effectively: Older users might be more receptive for password support tools. Lower
openness scores indicate that people are more conservative, “down to earth”, and appreciate
conventions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMcCrae1987ValidationFFM">229</a>]</span>. These values also appear plausible for older participants in the light of
related research <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSrivastava2003PersonalityAdulthood">310</a>]</span>. Thus, we conclude that the design of future password support
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
tools should be centered on different age groups. We will also see in Chapters <a 
href="dissch8.html#x98-2470008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:mental_models_pwm --></a> and
<a 
href="dissch12.html#x122-37000012">12<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:perdespassup --></a> that none of the current solutions are specifically tailored to different user groups.
Current one-size-fits-all solutions might hence explain to some degree why <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWMs</a> are still
underused.

<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >Egelman and Peer highlighted the importance of the the question <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">which psychographic segments</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">should be targeted [in security and privacy mitigations]? </span>While they focused on their newly
developed SeBIS scale and other psychometric constructs, we are able to give new pointers for
segmenting users based on their Big-Five traits in conjunction with demographic factors. To
approach the segmentation, we can look at the overall influences of personality and demographic
factors on different metrics. Table <span

In study 1, the primary observation was that neuroticism was associated with difficulty to create an
emoji password. Neuroticism was not associated with any perception metric in study 2, but the
third study revealed an interesting association between neuroticsm and self-selected
passwords. Metrics in the first and the third study revolve around password <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">creation</span>: It
appears to be both <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">easier </span>to find a password expressing emotions for participants scoring
high on neuroticism, and their passwords turned out significantly <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">longer </span>in the third
study. Thus, targeting neuroticism with persuasive interventions during password creation
might boost these positive associations. Nudges should thus focus on making emotional
state more <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">salient </span>and point out benefits of password length to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">positively reinforce </span>this
behavior.

<!--l. 129--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x88-2360007.5.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Openness</span></span>
The usability of different composition policies was not associated with openness, but the perception
of password strength showed conclusive associations in that passwords were generally judged
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">weaker </span>with higher openness scores. Participants strongly showing the openness trait were also
more likely to base their decision on <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">password length </span>rather than the number of digits. In study
3, we observed that coping strategies involving a password manager were <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">less likely</span>
to be found with participants with high openness scores. The significant associations,
and absence thereof, tell a conclusive story if we look at passphrases and mnemonic
phrase-based passwords. Those types of passwords are strong and often not overly complex

They also easily exceed length requirements. If they consist of uppercase and lowercase
letters, and are separated with regular punctuation symbols, there is no need to add digits
to meet a three-class requirement: the passphrase is already complex enough. All this
is visible in the study behavior of participants scoring high on openness, despite the
absence of associations between openness and the type of created password in study
3.

Like openness, conscientiousness was a major factor in study 2. There was evidence that
participants, who strongly show this trait, tend to believe a more <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">complex </span>password is
better than a long password. We could explain this finding by looking at the attributes
that are usually found with conscientious people: diligence and neatness. Following
password rules requires these facets to ensure a strong outcome. The results in study
1 (less time taken to create a password) and study 3 (slight tendency to refrain from
memorizing passwords) are harder to interpret. We could expect that crafting a strong
memorable password takes due diligence and more time, thus the shorter time spent
by conscientious participants is counterintuitive. Perhaps it is due to the measurement
approach in our study. We started taking the time as soon as the password field was
focused and the timing ended when the field lost focus (“blur” event). It is possible that
conscientious participants took their time to reflect on what they wanted to enter into the
field, and only then started the task. However, we do not have the data to support this
argument.

Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> shows that agreeableness only showed a conclusive result in study 1. A more demanding
policy like 3class12 did not appeal to participants scoring high on agreeableness, while they did
favor the emoji-policy much more. Cheerfulness, empathy and cooperation are often characteristics
represented by this trait. Participants might have favored cheerful emojis to cooperate on finding a
suitable solution together. Thus, password selection could have been more fun and thus more
pleasing for those participants. Since there was no sign of focusing on password strength, we
hypothesize that memorability might be more important for them. Regarding extraversion, we
found that participants scoring high on this trait disliked a word-based policy and were more likely
to memorize passwords than writing them down. This is probably the most difficult result
to interpret, because extraversion is a more situationally dependent trait than the four
others – a phenomenon coined as “ambiversion” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGrant2013Ambivert">140</a>]</span>. This could have become visible if
our regression models had shown more curvilinear relationships, but those were not
significantly more likely for extraversion than for other traits. We therefore refrain from further

From Table <span

with demographic variables as predictors. This was especially true for study 3, where almost all
outcomes were associated with having experience or education in a computer-science related field.
This is an unsurprising finding, because this user group can better judge the implications of their
behavior. Nevertheless, the additional factors help us segment user groups in higher
detail.

<!--l. 150--><p class="noindent" >With the above themes and stories, we are able to derive a number of user segments that can be

<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >Using our personas, it is possible to address personality facets in real-time feedback during
password creation. In the wild, we encounter password meters that estimate the strength of the
password and in some cases even provide verbal feedback about what the user can do to improve
the password (see <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">48</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">369</a>]</span>). A simple approach tries to convince the user to pick a
stronger password by <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">suggesting a new one </span>or a modified version of the entered password
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>, <a

href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 165--><p class="noindent" >Coming back to the finding that personality had a notable effect on how participants <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">compared </span>two
passwords, we suppose that it plays a role for real-time suggestions, too. How a modified version
or newly generated password is received likely depends on the user’s personality. On
mobile devices, the user’s password might be visible in clear text while they enter it <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span>.
Displaying an alternative password then resembles the comparison task from our study, and
they might wonder which one is stronger. Strength feedback facilitates answering this
question. It seems to be easier for <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">conscientious </span>people to assess the strength of their
password, if there is a clear list of requirements than can be “checked off”, to make it
superior to the suggested password (see the persona 3 “Taylor Tang” in Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). At the
same time, users who strongly show the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">openness </span>trait seem to benefit from data-driven
background information about the strength estimation algorithm. We conclude that Ur et al.’s
meter might be especially helpful for the persona 2 (Frankie Fizz). To make it work
for persona 1 (Jamey Jones), it needs to be more reassuring than it currently is: The
version presented at CHI 2017 constructively criticizes the user’s password and suggests
alterations. Adding a positive message might make persona 1 more receptive for this kind of
suggestions.
</p><!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, we found that demographic factors are useful to segment audiences. We found that
older participants in our third study were more likely to appreciate if they do not need
to memorize passwords, which was considered in persona 4 (Elliot Elis). They were
more likely to use a password manager, paper notes or reusing passwords to reduce
cognitive efforts. Thus, there is a great opportunity to suggest a coping strategy instead of a
stronger password. For instance, websites or browsers could extend sign-up forms with a
prompt to use a password manager. Pointing out the value of not having to memorize
the newly created password could speak to older users and drive adoption rates. It is
very important that the user journey from sign-up to password-manager set-up is simple
enough to meet persona 4’s needs. During account creation, interventions can leverage
the “opportune moment”: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Kairos</span>, one of the persuasion principles presented in Section
<a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1100003.4.2">3.4.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:persuasive_patterns --></a>, likely possesses a higher nudging power than, e.g. a news article recommending a
password manager, because users are experiencing the problem first-hand during account
creation.

<!--l. 180--><p class="noindent" >In our studies, we <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">explicitly </span>measured personality through psychometric constructs. This was
straightforward, because online studies have become a reliable go-to method to study passwords.
However, in many cases, omnibus tests like ANOVAs fail to reveal significant effects,
and confounding variables could blur causality. Only few such covariates have been
considered beyond demographic information. Our studies highlight that personality is a
promising candidate to consider: for instance, average password strength perceptions
were distributed normally. However, using general models, the underlying associations
became visible and were statistically significant. Thus, psychometrics should not be
neglected, so we can boost efficacy of security mitigations for different user segments
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2015AverageUser">98</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 182--><p class="noindent" >Still, extending surveys with long psychometric constructs is probably unrealistic. In our studies we
used 50 and 21-item constructs. The latter already showed slightly reduced internal
consistency. Thus, to keep studies short, to prevent participant fatigue, and to obtain reliable
data, we propose focusing on the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">openness </span>and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">neuroticism </span>personality traits. Their
associations were most stable in our studies and provided a coherent picture. They can be
measured with only a couple of items (between 9 and 20), so the corresponding study part is
finished within a few minutes. Nevertheless, the specific choice of the traits should be
backed up by confirmatory studies in the future, and may also depend on the research
question.
</p><!--l. 184--><p class="noindent" >Adding even a few more items to a questionnaire might be impossible due to study constraints
like budget or timeliness of data elicitation. There are, however, promising solutions to
quickly and inexpensively obtain personality data on all dimensions from a user’s past
behavior. It is possible to infer personality facets from <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">social media data</span>, e.g. public
interactions on Facebook <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYouyou2015Personality">386</a>]</span>. Youyou et al. found that such metrics can even outperform
psychometric questionnaires. Stachl et al., as well as De Montjoye et al. found conclusive
associations between <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">smartphone usage </span>and personality traits <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeMontjoye2013">80</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XStachl2017PersonalitySmartphones">311</a>]</span>. We thus suggest
requesting permission to read either smartphone or social network data as part of the study.
Crowd-workers in a large-scale study by Bentley and Chen, for instance, showed little
concern to install software on smartphones for research purposes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBentley2015Phonebook">20</a>]</span>. While we would not
go so far as to read all contacts, call and message history, we believe a differentially

<!--l. 189--><p class="noindent" >After consultation with statisticians, we opted for the use of generalized additive models (GAMs).
Their usefulness hinges on the interpretability of their corresponding regression plots. Traditional
indicators like (un-)standardized coefficients are limited in their contribution to gauge marginal
associations and must be interpreted with special caution. In the case of logistic regression,
standardizing binary variables is not useful, but we reported beta values to describe the slopes in the
plots. Especially in study 2, we tried to select the model with the highest goodness of fit as
indicated by the adjusted R-square value. We also considered the models’ Akaike information
criterion (AIC) to move forward. Here, increases and decreases of the AIC matched those
of the R-square value. Interestingly, the models achieved better fit than related work
on personality in privacy behavior <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 192--><p class="noindent" >In three studies with a total of 440 participants, we broadly explored associations between
personality traits and password behavior. This effort was one of the first of its kind. We focused on
the relationship between the Big-Five model and password policies, strength perceptions, password
selection, and coping strategies, while controlling for demographic factors. We found evidence for
associations between (a) the usability of password policies and the neuroticism trait; (b) password
strength perceptions and openness, respectively conscientiousness; (c) password length and
neuroticism; (d) coping strategies and extraversion; and (e) IT-background and more secure
behavior. Although the associations were not always particularly strong, they are still useful to
inform the design of persuasive interventions and password policies. To that end, a set of four

<!--l. 195--><p class="noindent" >Our work was of exploratory nature. Thus, the next step should be a focused study that increases
statistical power to confirm or refute the associations. We provided a user segmentation in our
personas to derive testable hypotheses. The refined knowledge about personality traits can be used
to personalize password feedback and make it more effective. As pointed out by related work, some
users overestimate the strength improvement of using digits in passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>, which we also saw
in studies 2 and 3. However, not all participants were equally influenced by digits or different
character classes inside passwords. Respecting the psychographics in real-time feedback while
carefully enforcing sensible policies could make these messages more effective. Besides,
personality traits can inform choice architectures beyond passwords. For example, the
Choose-Your-Own-Authentication approach <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2015CYOA">125</a>]</span> can benefit from improved default settings
depending on personality trait characteristics. The collection and aggregation of the necessary
information could be done implicitly on mobile phones or social networks <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeMontjoye2013">80</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XStachl2017PersonalitySmartphones">311</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XYouyou2015Personality">386</a>]</span>.
We see this a promising opportunity to improve the user experience of authentication
mechanisms, because off-the-shelf technology can already achieve this goal. Finally, in light of
some participants being more positive towards including emoji in their passwords opens
new possibilities for password authentication. Emoji usage itself has been shown to be
associated with personality <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMarengo2017EmojiPersonality">223</a>]</span>, which is supported by our research. Thus, it is important to
investigate how personality traits might be exploited to model password strength of
emoji-passwords.
