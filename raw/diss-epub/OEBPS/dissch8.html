<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >An important spillover of our previous exploration is that password managers are more likely
adopted the longer people had struggled with passwords: Older participants in the third personality
study (Section <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-2230007.4">7.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:personality:study3 --></a>) were more likely to use a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>. We have already corroborated market surveys
that indicate a generally low adoption rate of password management software. As discussed in
Sections <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-920003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:user-behavior --></a> and <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1050003.3.4">3.3.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:pwm_generators --></a>, it has been hypothesized that users do not fully trust third parties with their
credentials, so there seems to be an urge to stay in charge. Consequently, most users still
try to memorize their passwords. On the other hand, password managers do provide
many usability and security benefits, but why do users fail to see them? To this end,
we see a lack of understanding about how users make sense of password managers.
Our goal was to understand users’ mental models of password managers first and then
identify opportunities to improve them, which could increase adoption rates. We thus
aimed to answer the following research questions: <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">(1) </span>How do users think a password
manager works? <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">(2) </span>How does adopting a password manager change user attitudes and
behaviors?
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >To answer these questions, Martin Prinz and I explored attitudes and understandings in
semi-structured qualitative user interviews. To get a more complete picture, we interviewed both
people who already use a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a> and also people who prefer other coping strategies.

 id="x98-2490008.1"></a>Background and Context</h3>
<!--l. 33--><p class="noindent" >Password managers can be either built into web browsers or act as a standalone solution that is independent
of the password’s purpose. Dedicated password managers have existed since the mid to late 1990s. Web

 id="x98-249001f1"></a>
was probably one of the first programs to facilitate password management, when it first surfaced in
1998. Which of the browsers was first to add password storage capabilities cannot be easily traced
back, but all major browsers added this feature in the early 2000s. Given the long history of
supporting authentication with software tools, adoption of password managers is still at only
12% <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span>. Even security experts disagree on the specific security benefits of different
implementations<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss100.html#fn2x29"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x98-249002f2"></a>.
If the auto-fill feature is enabled, this can be used to create digital footprints for
individuals<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss101.html#fn3x29"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x98-249003f3"></a>.
Nevertheless, similar attack vectors could easily target regular password entry, and are not limited
to auto-fill.
</p><!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >There are different service architectures for handling passwords: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">offline </span>password managers keep a
database of encrypted passwords locally on the user’s machine, while <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">online </span>managers
provide more portability because passwords are held on a server or a distributed storage
solution <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMcCarney2012Tapas">228</a>]</span>. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">KeePass </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Password Safe </span>are notable representatives for the offline
storage paradigm, while the cloud-based approach is dominated by third-party solutions
like <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">LastPass</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">1Password</span>, and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Dashlane</span>. Browser vendors have also transitioned to
store passwords in the cloud, e.g. Apple Keychain for Safari, or Google Smartlock for
Chrome. On the one hand, this provides consistent user experiences across multiple devices.
On the other hand, such architectures create lock-in effects and dependencies on the
browser. To remove those drawbacks, third party tools typically provide browser-extensions
to automatically fill username and password fields. This way, they can create similar
experiences as built-in PWMs, but the user remains locked into one solution most of the

Norman suggests that exploring mental models provides predictive and explanatory power for
understanding an interaction <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XNorman1982ObservationsMentalModels">244</a>]</span>. Volkamer and Renaud meticulously described different aspects
and definitions of mental models, which are too elaborate to discuss in this work <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">352</a>]</span>. As a
takeaway, a mental model describes a user’s sense-making of any system they interact with.
Volkamer and Renaud highlight that mental models are not necessarily static, but can be shaped
with different cues to internal feedback loops (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). For our purposes, we use a simpler
definition provided by Young: Mental models are “collections of the root reasons why a person is
doing something” and “represent what a person is trying to accomplish in larger context, no
matter which tools are used” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYoung2008">385</a>, p.11]</span>. In our case, they describe the reasons for (not)
using a password manager, as explained by current actions to cope with authentication
tasks.

<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >In Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>, we took a quantitative approach to elicit data on the mental models. This was useful
because we tried to understand <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">what </span>contributed to password strength perceptions and by <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">how</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">much</span>. For password managers, related work on usage motivation is scarce, thus we strove to
answer <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">why </span>users perform certain actions and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">how </span>these could be supported by a password
manager. Therefore, qualitative methods were more useful. Eliciting such data to understand mental
models, Bravo-Lillo et al. relied on open-ended one-on-one interviews both with advanced and
novice user groups <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBravoLillo2011WarningsMentalModel">39</a>]</span>. They highlight the usefulness of this approach to understand thought
processes. Kang et al. relied on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">drawing tasks </span>to elicit additional data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKang2015MentalModelsDrawing">185</a>]</span>. Participants were
asked to sketch what they thought happens to their personal data when they interact with
different online services. During sketching, a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">concurrent think-aloud protocol </span>was used to
avoid misunderstandings. Once the data has been collected, Young suggests the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">affinity</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">diagramming </span>method to derive themes and identify opportunities for supporting tasks
<span class="cite">[<a

diagramming.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.2.1    </span> <a

<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >We chose to conduct semi-structured open-ended interviews for the reasons mentioned above. The
sessions started with a thorough briefing about the study purpose and asking for permission to
audio-record the conversation. The main questions were <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">(1) </span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Why do you need passwords? </span>and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">(2)</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">What is your strategy to manage multiple accounts?</span>. From there, the study followed up with more
fine-grained questions to investigate the specifics of these two aspects. Moreover, Bravo-Lillo et al.
showed the benefits of drawing tasks to find structural patterns in beliefs <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBravoLillo2011WarningsMentalModel">39</a>]</span>, so we also asked
participants to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">(3) </span><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">sketch how a password manager works</span>. This required that participants were
aware of <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWMs</a>. If they were not, they were told that it is a “piece of software that stores
a user’s password”, which was expected to be vague enough to explore participants’
unbiased expectations of this kind of software. The interviews took between five and 16
minutes.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x98-2530008.2.1"></a>Recruitment and Sample</h5>
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" >We first approached random passers-by on a popular street in Munich to obtain a diverse sample of
participants. Six interviewees were recruited this way. However, these first six interviews showed
that participants were unable to provide sufficient detail in answers to allow thorough analysis later.
Thus, we changed the recruiting method and approached employees of a design agency with which
we had collaborated in the past. We also knew that the agency’s policy required employees to
utilize password managers. Moreover, the user group was more likely capable of visually
expressing mental constructs, allowing for the envisioned analyses. Eight additional
participants were interviewed in this sample, giving a total of N=14 (6 male, 8 female).
They worked as experience designers and concept developers, and did not have formal
training in computer science or engineering. The age of all interviewees ranged from 20 to
41.
</p><!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >None of the interviewees in the first group had used a password manager before, so we call
this participant group the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices</span>. Since the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a> was part of the company policy, all
interviewees in the second group had used one before, so we call them the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives</span>. The
separation allowed us to detect a shift of expectations before and after adopting a password
manager.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x98-2540008.2.1"></a>Method Limitations</h5>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >The recruiting and sampling methods are inherently limited. The novice user group was asked at a
public spot, so it was difficult to provide enough contextual information and minimize distraction.
On the plus side, we achieved diversity and the face-to-face set-up reassures trust, because it was
clear that none of the information they gave us was going to be used to access their online accounts.
5 of 6 <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices </span>were unable to describe what a password manager was, before we gave them the
above definition. Thus, their decision to refrain from using a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a> was not made actively, but
rather results from the lack of awareness. This limits the analysis of attitudes and self-reported
behavior. Finally, the second user group has a homogeneous background: design and
communication. Moreover, they were all using the same password manager due to the policy at
their company. Finally, the size of the sample might have been too small to achieve
theoretical saturation, i.e. additional participants might have brought up aspects that were not
covered at all by the existing sample. All these limitations demand that the results not be
generalized to a larger population. Instead, they should be seen as rough trends that
help understand a first set of underlying mental models, rather than the entire spectrum

 id="x98-2560008.2.2"></a>Selection and Coping Strategies</h5>
<!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >All interviewees reuse passwords to cope with the multitude of accounts. Participants often
developed coping strategies without deliberation: they were unaware of how they cope with
passwords until we specifically requested more details. Only then did they reflect and
realize how they behave. One such revelation was that they categorize passwords in
different ways. For instance, the context in which they created an account, e.g. the URL or
policy of the corresponding website, was factored into passwords and facilitated the
decision-making process which password to pick from their portfolio (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> A). Similarly,
the perceived importance led to distinct categories, although the interviewees had not
realized this. Participants generally tried to justify their “insecure” behavior. Beside
memory burden of new secrets, time pressure was mentioned as reason for password
reuse.
</p><!--l. 92--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, we also heard an interesting, deliberate strategy that seldom appears in
the literature: two participants mentioned memorizing a list, or a list of letters that are
then transformed into a new, quasi-unique password. This method is comparable to the
Diceware technique (details in Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1040003.3.3">3.3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:passphrases --></a>). Instead of rolling a die to generate a random
number by which to look up a word from a list, those participants algorithmically select
the order of words/letters based on contextual cues (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> B and C). Another
participant said to have memorized a randomly generated password and reusing it many
times.
</p><!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >We also inquired situations when their strategies failed. The primary problem of having a multitude
of accounts was the correct <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">combination </span>of user-name and password, which is a common pitfall of
knowledge-based authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. Not only did they forget passwords, but also user names,
which is just as severe because web sites generally do not inform users which was the error source
to thwart attacks. Participants reportedly use a trial-and-error approach to go through their portfolio
and ultimately use self-serviced password resets as a convenient solution. Interviewees expected
that websites offer this kind of fallback scheme, because two of them do this on a regular
basis.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x98-2570008.2.2"></a>Password Manager Impact</h5>
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" >Overall, the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives </span>did not behave differently in their selection and coping strategies at
first sight. However, we found that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives </span>did in fact change some habits when they
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
had started using a password manager. First, although they were initially exposed to
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWMs</a> at work, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives </span>started using them in private shortly afterwards. This interaction
and experience with the tool led to their migrating passwords into the manager step
by step. One participant mentioned that it helps him stay organized where there was
“chaos” before (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> C). Others were somewhat ashamed of their weak practices
before using this kind of software. Password sharing with other users was the central
advantage for four interviewees, especially at work. It facilitates secure collaboration with
colleagues and clients. Participants do not memorize these passwords, because they often use
built-in password generators. They realized that shared passwords are short-lived because
colleagues leave or contracts with clients end, upon which passwords are invalidated. One
interviewee fully embraced generated passwords even for private purposes and only memorizes
his master password. Interestingly, however, for their most important accounts, most
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives </span>kept on manually crafting passwords and refrained from putting them into the
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>. Having used the tool and become aware of their own weak behavior in the past,
they had gained confidence in selecting stronger passwords. This gain of mastery left
them with a positive experience of password managers. As a contrast, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices </span>were all
comfortable with how they managed their passwords and did not show that sense of
insecurity.

 id="x98-2580008.2.2"></a>Drawing Tasks</h5>
<!--l. 107--><p class="noindent" >Participants were asked to sketch their thoughts whenever this was appropriate. We encouraged
them to sketch as much as possible. All participants mentioned that it was challenging to
communicate their understanding this way. Already for basic functionality and purpose of
passwords, we asked to create sketches. This task was still relatively easy for all interviewees.
Padlocks and keys were two of the most commonly drawn elements. It also helped to communicate
individual elaborate selection strategies (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). However, the difficulty rapidly
changed for the workings of a password manager. Here, especially <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices </span>struggled
with the task and could not proceed without further explanation, telling us that it is hard
to frame an unfamiliar concept with a sketch. Their drawings were more vague than
those of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives</span>, which might also be due to the different professional background and
expertise in creating concepts. The drawn elements and metaphors differed among the two
groups:
</p>
<!--l. 109--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x98-2590008.2.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Novices</span></span>
had a vague model of how such a password manager might work and found it especially
difficult to sketch this. The benefits and system architecture of the software were unclear to
them. One interesting drawing depicted a password manager as a virtual “brain” that acts
as a central hub to make the user’s life easier (Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> B). Another participant, who
reportedly used a Word document to keep track of his accounts, imagined a password
manager to behave the same way (Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> C). The only expected difference would be that
accessing the list of passwords would be protected by a password, which is indicated by
the keyhole and an arrow that points to it. This represents <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices’ </span>understanding on a
more general level, as they explained a password manager as a special way to manage a
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">secure list of passwords </span>that helps find the right ones. Five said that it facilitates logins
by allowing them to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">copy-and-paste </span>passwords from the manager into the webpage.

Since all active users were also visual communicators, it was somewhat easier for them to
sketch the workings of a password manager. They clearly focused on the interaction
between users and the system and highlighted the benefits in their drawings. Having
experienced the advantages, they strove to convey these visually and came up with more
details (cf. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). Instead of a password-table, we can see workflows that show the
interplay between user, database and website. Common components are UI elements
like input fields or buttons that link to other screens or entities. Only one interviewee
from the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">active </span>group refrained from UI elements and instead sketched a flow-chart.

<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >From the behavioral, attitudinal, and experiential data, we created a mental model schema in the
style of Young <span class="cite">[<a

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). We tried to stay close to the data as possible, but a few points
are enhanced by knowledge from related work. We briefly elaborate on the mental spaces to allow

First, users have a variety of particular needs when they are challenged to create a password. This
task tower describes both the constraints, prior experiences and strategies to accomplish the task.
Our participants often mentioned highly individual selection strategies that allow for both secure
and memorable secrets. From a support tool, they expected guidance and feedback. Password
generators that simplify this task can aid here.

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Log In</span></span>
Most prominently, authentication still involves <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">both </span>manual and automatic tasks. Interviewees
expected to copy and paste passwords from the manager to their browser, or at least
provide a way to retrieve password hints. On the other hand, participants expected that
support tools are deeply integrated into the browser by automatically filling password
fields in a highly reliable manner. If possible, the solution should work across multiple
devices.

The third mental space resembles the “Commit to password” and “Live with password” stages of
the Password Life Cycle <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. Each participant mentioned some way of organization strategy that
allowed them to live without password managers to some degree. However, these were not always
deliberate choices, but rather have formed over the years. Especially <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novice </span>users made sense of
password managers by their capability of protecting passwords, i.e. encrypting a list of passwords
rather than just storing them in a Word document. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Active </span>users were already aware of the sharing
capabilities and appreciate a simple process to reset passwords when they need to be invalidated for

<!--l. 141--><p class="noindent" >There were two important preconceptions about password mangers on the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">novices </span>side: simple
password lists and copy-paste interactions. Future password managers can leverage these models to
persuasively communicate functionality. The value proposition should thus ensure that potential
users understand that PWMs are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">not only </span>a secure list of user-names and passwords, but also help
them <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">select </span>passwords – a benefit that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">actives </span>had realized in retrospect. The <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password list</span>
metaphor is also useful to communicate automation features: explicitly showing new users that they
do not have to search through the list, nor copy and paste passwords from the list to the website
might help them understand the simplicity of the interaction paradigm. This can happen during an
onboarding user journey, e.g. with an image showing the steps saved by the PWM (cf. Figure
<span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.4.2    </span> <a 
 id="x98-2670008.4.2"></a>Increasing Sense of Agency</h4>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >While automation simplifies processes and thus improves usability, staying in control of
security-related interactions is important to users. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Novices </span>were confident in their current
behavior. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Actives </span>had realized that their past behavior was sub-optimal, but they had
gained confidence to create passwords and handle authentication for their most important
accounts on their own. As a consequence, a password manager needs to stay flexible
enough to respect user preferences for different account <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">categories</span>, e.g. unimportant
vs. important accounts. A PWM could learn which types of websites the user prefers
to handle on their own and refrain from asking to store the credentials at similar sites
in the future. Moreover, reassuring users that handling such situations on their own is
reasonable can inspire trust in the system. A PWM could automatically detect when it is
appropriate to offer help. Current managers only provide the opportunity to decide whether the
password should be saved, maybe saved later, or never be saved for a particular site.
Such decisions can be automated once enough training data has been provided by the
user.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.4.3    </span> <a 
 id="x98-2680008.4.3"></a>Leveraging Context</h4>
<!--l. 155--><p class="noindent" >Context factors can be leveraged by PWMs to adapt to different situations. For example,
usage-context informs future interactions. If the user sets up the system at work, this is an indicator
about how passwords are going to be categorized, how often they will be reset, and how likely they
are going to be shared with others. Adapting the interface to such scenarios can simplify
interactions and the formation of mental models of the benefits. Moreover, automated
generation of passwords is also context-dependent. As we have shown in Chapter <a 
href="dissch6.html#x83-1610006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:policies_reuse --></a>,
password policies in the wild impose varying restrictions on the use of characters. To avoid
user frustration arising from rejected passwords, e.g. because they contain forbidden
characters, the generator can ensure the random password meets the website’s composition
policy.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.4.4    </span> <a 
 id="x98-2690008.4.4"></a>Customization and Personalization</h4>
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >It is evident that current password managers work fundamentally differently compared to how users
normally cope with passwords. Our participants reused passwords with different strategies and
relied on digital documents, paper notes, and highly individual password creation or memorization
techniques. Beside the document-metaphor discussed above, the other strategies are not reproduced
by password managers. However, a general philosophy in user-centered design is the aim to “fix the
system” rather than to “fix the user” and acknowledge that people prefer maintaining existing
strategies, e.g., to make ensure being able to log in even without assistance. A PWM
can hence make a user’s creation experience more convenient by leveraging existing
strategies. For instance, it could let the user specify a creation technique: if they usually
modify a base-password depending on the context, the PWM could offer to generate
passwords like this in future scenarios, i.e., automate the modification strategy. While
this approach would not necessarily improve security, it could save the user time and
remove critical pain points. Besides, the user stays independent of the tool, because they
can reproduce their personal system and authenticate on other devices even without the
support.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">8.5    </span> <a 
 id="x98-2700008.5"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 170--><p class="noindent" >To understand additional psychological context factors of persuasive password support, we
explored the mental models of authentication tasks and password managers with a qualitative
approach. Both participants experienced with password managers and inexperienced novices shared
their insights, attitudes and behaviors during short interviews. Fourteen interviewees provided us
detailed descriptions of their password selection and coping strategies, and how they make sense of
supporting tools. We contribute evidence that (a) individual coping strategies persist even after
adopting a password manager for important accounts, (b) work environments serve as onboarding
triggers even for private use (RQ2), and (c) novices were mostly unaware of functionality and the
ramifications of adopting password managers (RQ1). These findings show that the value
proposition should be communicated concisely. One potential solution could compare the
benefits of using a PWM to inefficient and insecure password practices. At the same
time, future solutions should respect highly individual coping strategies to match user
behavior better. Ultimately, this could increase adoption and, more importantly, retention
