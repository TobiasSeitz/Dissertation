 id="x74-1230005"></a>Mental Models of Password Strength</h2>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >We start our discussion of empirical research with an investigation of psychological
context factors to explain the prevalence of weak passwords. The number of extremely
incautious passwords in breached databases is alarming <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2009PCFG">366</a>]</span>. It could be interpreted such
that users might not realize that their passwords are insufficient to protect accounts. I
challenge this notion in this chapter. If users are able to judge the strength of a given
password, it is fair to assume they can select an appropriately strong one depending on the
situation. There is first empirical evidence that users can assess passwords more accurately
than one might think: Ur et al. showed that, with a few exceptions, users are able to
gauge the strength of a given password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. In this chapter, we follow up this result by
extending the range of password topologies, i.e. the composition and types of passwords.
Understanding the users’ mental models of password strength allows us to craft feedback
more persuasively, because it can take into account what users already know about the
strength of their own passwords. In particular, we address the following research questions:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">How well can users identify weak and strong passwords?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">What types of password topologies lead to inaccurate perceptions?</li></ul>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Beside the results, this chapter presents a novel method to answer our research questions. In the
following, we discuss the background of the research and provide new insights into mental models
of password strength.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1    </span> <a 
 id="x74-1250005.1"></a>Background and Context</h3>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Users create passwords on a regular basis. As discussed in Chapter <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-760003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:rw:user_perspective --></a>, previous research
indicates that users most commonly resort to weak passwords that are easy to remember. In
case the account value is higher, however, it is suspected that users invest more effort
into creating a stronger password. Password meters are helpful in this context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>. Yet,
even strong passwords are often ineffective against sophisticated guessing attacks, so it
stands to reason that users have a subpar mental model of what makes a strong password.
This has been a commonly accepted assumption <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2015ImperfectAuthentication">35</a>]</span> but it oversimplifies the state of
affairs.
</p><!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >Mental models change over time – both on a micro- and a macro-scale. At micro-scale, it is evident
that people select their first passwords in their teenage years and without much care for security
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">354</a>]</span>. Over time, users are exposed to password advice and educational nudges: popular news
portals regularly publish new articles that report on data breaches or warn about risky online
behavior. Furthermore, incidents in one’s own social network <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span> raise awareness about
the topic and can spark plans to behave differently in the future. Moreover, by creating
many accounts, users encounter different password policies and feedback tools. Users
need to make sense of these constraints and might reflect on their password choice.
Consequently, an individual’s mental model of password strength is impacted if feedback
and policy instructions are well-designed <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>. The literature already has some
evidence that, overall, password behavior has positively changed in the past few decades
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRiley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo">269</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSchneier2006RealWorldPasswords">282</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Zooming out to the macro level, efforts to educate users may have already paid off. In the early
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
days of research in Usable Security, often the user was seen as the “weakest link” in a secure
system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1997MakingPWsSecureAndUsable">4</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>]</span>. When Florêncio and Herley conducted their large-scale study in 2006/2007, they
noticed that the entropy of the passwords was generally low, but high-value accounts were
protected a bit better. In 2015, Ur et al. found that users’ mental models had become more accurate
which allowed them to create stronger and memorable passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>. A year later, they
presented an in-depth analysis of the perceptions of password strength <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. They found that for
the most part, participants in their online-study were capable of identifying the factors that add
to password strength. Shay et al. already used “perceived strength” as a proxy metric
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>]</span>, and it seems this is a better approach than one might think. For a few notable
exceptions, though, certain password characteristics fooled participants. Ur et al. argue that
errors in mental models about strength arise from false understandings of attackers.
Consequently, it would be necessary to shift the focus in user education from password strength
towards attack models, because users already have a fairly accurate understanding of
strength.
</p><!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Florêncio et al. put forward a formal model as to why users behave insecurely. Their central
argument is that it is inevitable to choose weak passwords for some accounts and that users are well
aware of their behavior. Yet, if users have a faulty understanding of password strength then the
selection process is biased. If users also show the overconfidence bias, where people are
subjectively more confident in their abilities and judgments than the objective accuracy of the
judgments <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSimonson1989ChoiceBasedOnReasons">307</a>]</span>, this could indeed lead to considerable risks. Password meters could counteract
these biases, but only if they achieve to inform – and potentially disrupt – the user’s mental model
of password strength.
</p><!--l. 54--><p class="noindent" >In summary, having a clear mental model of what makes for a strong password is essential to make
the decision whether to expend the effort and create one or not. While there are initial results, the
perceptions of these factors are still understudied to this point.

 id="x74-1260005.2"></a>Approach: PASDJO - The Password Game</h3>
<!--l. 67--><p class="noindent" >To evaluate (in)accuracies in mental models about password strength, I chose to have users rate
passwords similarly to the study task in Ur et al.’s study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. In their presentation at CHI 2016, they
challenged the audience to assess the strength of a couple of passwords on the slides. This sparked
the idea of making a game out of this study topic. The game is called PASDJO (pronounced “Pass

To open the game to a large audience, I decided to implement it as a web-application that runs in

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x74-1270005.2.1"></a>Game Mechanics and Design Elements</h4>
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >The game is relatively simple: Players judge how strong or weak a given password is. They receive
points by accurately estimating the strength of a given password on a scale from 1 (weak) to 5
(strong). The game follows similar design strategies for the password topologies as Ur et al.’s
online study, but passwords are either randomly taken from large dictionaries or generated on the
fly. To induce intuitive estimations, a time-limit is enforced while a “highscore” acts as incentive to
estimate as accurately as possible. To reach higher scores, one has to judge as many passwords as
possible in 60 seconds.
</p><!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x74-1280005.2.1"></a>Scoring and Metrics</h5>
<!--l. 79--><p class="noindent" >A crucial point of the game is how the passwords are rated objectively. Here, we rely on the zxcvbn
library<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss76.html#fn2x16"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x74-128001f2"></a>
(described in detail in Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-550002.3">2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:pw_strength_metrics --></a>) because it is highly reliable and straightforward to use on a web
page. It also comes with a number of word lists that are helpful to implement different scenarios,
respectively conditions. Beside the guess-number metric, zxcvbn also scores passwords on a scale
from zero (weak) to four (strong). We translate this scale to one star (weak) to five stars (strong) in
the game.
</p><!--l. 81--><p class="noindent" >For a correct estimation, i.e. a match between the zxcvbn score and the player’s rating, a player is
awarded 100 points. The difference between the user’s rating and the zxcvbn score is the <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">deviation</span>
(<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">D</span>). A player’s rating can deviate by at most four stars, e.g. if they rate a five-star password with a
score of one and vice versa. In that case, the player should not get any points, but in all other cases,
the player is still awarded a few points. For each integral deviation in either direction there is a
penalty of 25 minus-points (maximum of 100 points, at most 4 errors, which leads to <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">100</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">∕</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">4 = 25</span>).
The points of all estimations are summed up and build the <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">achieved </span>score (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">A</span>). As an overall
accuracy measure, at the end of the game we calculate the ratio of achieved and possible
points and display it as percentage (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>). The game thus implements the following scoring
function, where <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">U </span>is the user’s estimation on a scale from 1 to 5, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">Z </span>is the zxcvbn score

limit.

<!--l. 111--><p class="noindent" >We used a number of persuasive techniques (see Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1060003.4">3.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:persuasive-interventions --></a>) in the design of the game. Most of
them relate to the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">Persuasive Authentication Framework</a> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. First of all, we lower the barrier to
play the game through <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">simplification</span>: the task is immediately clear and does not require special
skills. Since one round only takes sixty seconds, it is easier for users to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">commit </span>to finish the game.
The feedback screen uses positive <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">language </span>to create the notion of a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social interaction</span>, which also
serves <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">self-monitoring</span>. Also, feedback and points serve as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">reinforcement </span>for correct
ratings, i.e. a subtle form of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">conditioning</span>. Moreover, the user interface is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">tailored </span>to
the user, as they can see their own previous scores. Players can also create an account
through Google-federated <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SSO">SSO</a>. If they log in, their profile picture and a personal greeting
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">personalize </span>their experience. Through the player’s eyes, the game’s strength ratings are
“right”, which can be attributed to the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">authority </span>principle. Finally, the game leverages the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">goal-gradient effect </span>by giving the player small amounts of points even for inaccurate estimations.

round.

href="dissli2.html#XUr2015MeasuringRealWorldAccuracies">346</a>]</span> unless the adversary launches a targeted attack where personal information
plays a more important role. Zxcvbn rates the top 1000 passwords with a score of one (e.g.
“12345”, “password”, “monkey”), and the remaining passwords are scored with two
stars (e.g. “iloveyou2”, “skywalker”, “apollo13”). It is worth noting that many of these
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
passwords would not be accepted anymore by websites as common policies demand
at least 8 characters (see Chapter <a

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Mangled passwords: </span></span>
For the mangled password condition, we take the same list of the top 47023 passwords, but we
algorithmically substitute certain characters. The substitutions look like “leet” / “l33t” speak, which
is a typical way to try to increase password strength <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDas2014TangledWeb">67</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>. For instance, an “a” is replaced by
an “@”, or an “s” is substituted with the dollar sign “$”. Also, random characters are
transformed to uppercase. To allow recognizing the original word, we only mangle up to
30% of the characters of the password. Since we only use substitutions that zxcvbn
recognizes, mangled passwords mostly receive a score of two. However, in rare occasions,
they get higher or lower scores depending on the specific character constellation, e.g.,
“p@ssw0rd” (1), “b0n3he@d” (2), “fireFI9hter” (3), “123qaz456w$x” (4), “123Q@z4s6w$x”
(5).

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Random passwords: </span></span>
We implemented a simple string generation algorithm to create random passwords. They are
lowercase alphanumeric passwords containing letters from the German alphabet, i.e. [a-z0-9äöü].
Zxcvbn consistently gives them a score of four, which makes them easy to rate. In a real-world
attack they can only be brute-forced <span class="cite">[<a

 id="x74-1340005.2.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Passphrases: </span></span>
We combine two entries from the English Wikipedia index to create a passphrase (also shipped
with zxcvbn). The words were required to be between 4 and 11 characters long. This restriction
leads to a dictionary size of 27202 entries. Thus, there are <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">27202</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span> <span

class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">9</span> possible combinations,
which is unpredictable enough to withstand online guessing attacks. This is reflected by the rather
high scores: zxcvbn gives passphrases mostly a score of three or four, e.g. “armedtamils” (3),
“boostedeuros” (4). If the words appear in other dictionaries, e.g. the “TV subtitles”
word list, they are more likely to result in a score of three. However, for a user it is not
straight-forward to tell whether a passphrase scores three or four points, which makes
this condition harder to get right. The game is expected to benefit from this element of
<span

 id="x74-1350005.2.3"></a>Benefits and Shortcomings of the Game-based Approach</h4>
<!--l. 134--><p class="noindent" >Since the game was deployed publicly, the method can be denoted as an unsupervised in-the-wild
study. Ur et al.’s study is closely linked to ours, but they used an online survey and recruited
participants through <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a>. In comparison to an online survey, our approach features certain
benefits and shortcomings as discussed in the following.
</p><!--l. 136--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x74-1360005.2.3"></a>Benefits of the Game-based Approach</h5>
<!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Easy collection of multiple data points per user </span>The game can be played over and over. A survey
could also be taken multiple times, but this is usually impractical because there is a fixed set of
options, and reassessing the same passwords is unnecessary. Besides, if people could repeatedly
participate via MTurk this would mean that they would be paid for each completion, which drives
costs.
</p><!--l. 140--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Possibility to provide feedback </span>After the game, the players can review their ratings and find out
how they performed. Implementing such a feedback loop is much more complicated and often
impossible with current survey tools. Survey usually debrief participants about the general purpose
of study, but it is difficult to tailor the debrief to the individual participant, i.e. tell them how they
performed.
</p><!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Randomization and password space </span>Ur et al.’s study was well-designed because it tested a wide
range of password characteristics and there were multiple options per condition. However,
the options were predefined by the researchers and limited in that sense. In our case,
we can pick passwords from much larger word-lists at random and use algorithms to
randomly adjust certain characteristics. This allows for higher internal validity of the data
collection.
</p><!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Intrinsic Motivation </span>Participants in an online survey often receive an incentive to participate. In an
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a>-study each participant receives a small amount of money. Contrarily, there is no extrinsic
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
incentive to play PASDJO and we can leverage the players’ intrinsic motivation.
</p><!--l. 149--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Intuition </span>The game uses time pressure to induce intuitive responses. Thus, if playing
fast enough, we expect to measure System 1’s responses instead of System 2 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKahnemann2011FastAndSlow">183</a>]</span>.
This is vital because password selection is often a System 1 process, i.e. intuitive and
automatic. In an online survey, the participants can take as much time as they’d like to reason
about their response. However, this is a hypothetic benefit that needs further empirical
evidence.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x74-1370005.2.3"></a>Drawbacks of the Game-based Approach</h5>
<!--l. 152--><p class="noindent" >The game approach towards collecting password strength perceptions naturally entails
drawbacks, too. First and foremost, we do not collect demographic data. In a survey,
it is common practice to include questions about basic demographic information. If
we included such questions as part of our game, we might have scared off users and
damaged persuasive strategies. Thus, the collected data stems from an unknown population,
which is a limitation. In the future, we might address this issue by iterating on designs
that ask people to provide some basic demographic information, e.g. after playing three
times.
</p><!--l. 154--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, the lack of demographic data also makes it hard to track usage across multiple
devices. The same player could first get in touch on a desktop and then later decide to keep playing
on their mobile. Allowing users to log in and synchronize their game history can mitigate this
problem to some degree.
</p><!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >Last, ethically running password studies (see Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-770003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:methodology --></a>) demands that participants be debriefed
appropriately. In our case, we provide a separate “About” page that is accessible from anywhere in
the app. The information on the about page points out that users should refrain from using the
generated passwords as their own and that our strength estimation is only an estimate. Nevertheless,
it requires that users seek this kind of information, which – realistically – only few people might
do. Therefore, as a small encouragement to read it, we require users to confirm a consent-dialog
that also points them to the about page. So far, we have no data on how many people
looked at this page, but this is an easy fix for the future, e.g. by adding an analytics
library.

<!--l. 175--><p class="noindent" >We leveraged user experience heuristics to design the game for a large
audience. Among others, we based our solution on the Progressive Web-App

href="diss80.html#fn6x16"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x74-138007f6"></a>,
which we hoped would lower the barrier to engage with the game. Since we expected many people
from Germany would play the game, the interface is fully localized. Depending on the
browser language, it automatically picks the preferred language. Moreover, the interface is
responsive to different screen sizes to provide a seamless experience. We chose a short URL
<a 
href="pasdjo.de" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">pasdjo.de</span></a> to facilitate visiting the website from mobile devices where typing is cumbersome.
Upon visiting the web page, a welcome screen briefly explains the rules (see Figure
<a 
href="#x74-138004r1">5.3a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pasdjo:welcome-screen --></a>). As part of our onboarding process, we give users the opportunity to try out the
rating interface, so they can get comfortable even before they play for the first time.
For mobile users, we had to ensure that the game loads quickly. This is challenging,
because we have to transfer a number of word lists to generate the passwords randomly.
Therefore, we used a lazy-loading design pattern to render the UI first and load data in the
background. At the same time, we minimize and compress the source files to reduce data
transfers. The first page load consumes 1.6 MB of data. To ensure subsequent visits are
faster and do not stress the user’s mobile quota, a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">service-worker </span>caches resources in the
background. It intercepts requests to the remote server in the future and instead serves local
resources<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss81.html#fn7x16"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x74-138008f7"></a>.
This strategy reduces the transfer size for subsequent requests to a mere 10.3 KB, which are mostly
consumed by authentication and incremental synchronization.

a shared, known account. Posters at our institution kept advertising the game, and it was later
shown at student orientation days. Thus, it is very likely that the sample stems from a group of
mostly younger adults who are interested in technical innovation. After removing log data from the
known demo accounts, 115 users remained in the data set who had played at least one game on a
device unknown to us. Only two users chose to log in to keep their history synchronized across

(SD=2.3, Min=1, Max=16). The time pressure motivated users to rate as many passwords as
possible. We found that an average of 24.44 passwords (SD=10.39) were rated per game, which
amounts to 5915 passwords rated. Users spent <span

zxcvbn strength estimates were fairly consistent within each condition (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). Random
passwords consistently received a zxcvbn score of 4 out of 5 stars. Common passwords were either
rated with 1 or 2. Passwords in the Mangled condition filled the full spectrum of ratings,
but the majority had a score of 2. Interestingly, passphrases were the least predictable
condition. From <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 1414 </span>passphrases, 25.03% received a score of 3, and 74.54% a

e.g. <span 
class="ectt-1200">soilwithin </span>or <span 
class="ectt-1200">augsburgtime</span>, but it is not clear why this was the case (perhaps
because one of the words had a very low guess number). However, the vast majority
of passphrase-scores are explicable with the number of characters. For the users, the
length of the passphrase is then the only criterion to decide between a score of 3 and
4.

indicator of mental models of password strength. In their first game, players achieved an
average score of 2010 points (SD=653.16, Min=350, Max=3675), which translated to an
average accuracy of 74.58 % of the achievable points. Moreover, players rated 27.21
passwords in their first game (SD=8.34), which is more than in subsequent games, albeit
not significantly (<span

more game. We tried to model their progress through a linear regression with gameIndex as
predictor and achieved percentage as dependent variable. To account for the fact that
some users played more rounds per game, we weighted the percentage with the number
of passwords rated in that game. The model shows that players were able to improve
their accuracy by playing multiple times (F(1)=49.37, <span

0.23). The increased accuracy is mostly due to more accurate estimation of passphrases:
performing linear regressions with average deviation of each condition as dependent
variable, with gameIndex as predictor, we observed that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">only passphrases </span>have a non-trivial
model fit (<span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-90">adj</span> = 0.19). For all other dependents, gameIndex had virtually no effect on
the tendency. Players therefore primarily learned to estimate passphrases. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>
visualizes the progress of users who played at least twice. In there, it is also evident that the
slope is not stringent, i.e. an individual user’s accuracy does not necessarily increase
steadily. We attribute this to the element of randomness in the game, which makes it more
difficult in some cases to rate the passwords, while it might be easier in a subsequent
game.

The mangled passwords were algorithmically altered versions of common passwords. This often
made it hard to figure out the original password. Perhaps, the mangled passwords sometimes
seemed more like random passwords which is why they were the only overestimated condition in
the first sample. The new condition “Predictable” mimicks the most predictable user alterations.
The resulting passwords consist of a capitalized dictionary word with a predictable suffix, e.g.
‘123’ or ‘!’. There were 12 predefined suffixes, and they were randomly appended to the dictionary
word.

After realizing that virtually no passwords had received a score of 5 in the first sample, I fine-tuned
the generation of passphrases and random passwords. Passphrases were now either two or three
words. Separators (e.g. a dash “-”) were inserted in between the words. Random passwords used to
be ten characters long in version 1. In version two their length is also randomized between 7 and 15
characters. This leads to a higher variety of zxcvbn scores. The resulting passwords sometimes
resemble the mangled condition, which is a greater challenge for the players. Moreover, I
increased the likelihood of common passwords from the top 100 by a factor of two.
All measures resulted in a much more diverse spectrum of scores as shown in Figure

The players’ achieved score (<span

a player rated as many passwords as possible without spending much thought on the
strength, they still achieved a high score, albeit not a high accuracy. Therefore, the accuracy
is now used as a “penalty” by multiplying the achieved score with the accuracy (e.g.

Furthermore, the players had to figure out why their ratings deviated from the zxcvbn scores on
their own. Now, the feedback screen contains a small indication as to how the score
was calculated (see Figure <span

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.1    </span> <a

<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" >Overall, we can attest players a fairly good performance. This assessment resounds to Ur et al.’s
results <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. Players performed best in the “Common” condition, i.e. they can identify commonly
used passwords with high certainty. Algorithmically mangled – but common! – passwords caused a
bit more trouble. The fact that this was the only condition where people judged strength as too
high reveals the users’ mental model: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">if one substitutes individual letters with digits and</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">symbols, the password must become stronger</span>. The additional data for version 1 helped
narrow down the confidence intervals and moving closer to the “actual truth”. After about
one year, the average rating for mangled passwords had moved closer to the zxcvbn
score (compare Figures <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> and <a 
href="#x74-151001r1">5.13a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:pasdjo:1y-performance --></a>). Perhaps this means that the players that followed
(<span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">Δ(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) = 70</span>) had a better mental model of the implications of character substitutions. However,
since none of the other average ratings changed significantly, the shift might be due to
chance.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.2    </span> <a 
 id="x74-1540005.4.2"></a>Strength Perception vs. Selection</h4>
<!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" >Users rarely rate the strength of passwords. The only notable instance where this happens is when
users see passwords that are shared with them. There is growing evidence that shared passwords are
typically weak <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2010EncounteringPasswordRequirements">298</a>, <a

href="dissli2.html#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">368</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">389</a>]</span>: Sharing passwords is easier if it is a regular
dictionary word, with predictable suffixes, like <span 
class="ectt-1200">Ferrari123</span>. It would be extremely cumbersome
to dictate a password like <span 
class="ectt-1200">8zJ,uwD’dXBTUVub </span>over the phone, especially if the other
person needs it urgently. As a consequence, passwords shared among users might have
affected players’ strength ratings. We did not observe this in our data: The conditions
that contained regular words were deemed weak. Ur et al.’s findings point in the same
direction.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 305--><p class="noindent" >We can safely assume that users in our sample know that common passwords are weak, and
that they are misguided by character substitutions. We believe that this has immediate
implications on their selection behavior: it can be hypothesized that users intentionally pick
weak passwords – as data breaches reveal time and time again. If they think a stronger
password is necessary, they mangle weak passwords and overestimate the security benefits.
Therefore, there is a lesson we can learn here: users do not need feedback on obviously weak
passwords. They <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">do </span>need feedback if they select a predictably altered password. Ur
et al. mention this already in their recent work on password meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>. However,
many password meters and feedback mechanisms do not yet discourage predictable
mangling.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.3    </span> <a 
 id="x74-1550005.4.3"></a>Intuition or Deliberation?</h4>
<!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" >PASDJO players spent 2.45 seconds on average to rate the strength of each password. Which kind
of thinking processes were responsible here? Is it probable that users acted intuitively (System 1) or
did they ponder enough to activate System 2 processes (see Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1070003.4.1">3.4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:persuasion-psycho-background --></a>)? We can find evidence
for both. In their first game, fast players were about as accurate as slow players. For those
players who played multiple games, we used the number of passwords they managed to
rate as weight in regression models. We did this for validity reasons, but, in fact, the
effect was negligible: We ran the tests without the weight and model fit did not change
notably. All this is interesting because fast players were most likely to use <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">heuristics</span>, or
as Acquisiti et al. calls them: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mental shortcuts </span>to come to an assessment. Otherwise
they would have been less accurate or slower. This is one piece of evidence that the
time pressure can induce System 1 thinking processes. The slower players on the other
hand obviously had to think harder to estimate password strength; System 2 had to be
activated. In PASDJO v2, zxcvbn scores for passphrases and random passwords were
much more diverse (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). So, if a fast player wanted to be accurate in these
cases, they needed to rely on two heuristics: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">are there dictionary words or does it look</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">random? </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">how many characters are in the password? </span>Only then does one have a chance
to assess strength correctly. For the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">length</span>-heuristic, it is even necessary to count the
characters. We can safely assume that 2.45 seconds are not enough to make the distinction
between a 17 character (average score = 3.9) and a 19 character passphrase (average score:
5.0). For random passwords, it could be feasible to count characters, because scores are
much more predictable (length(7,8)<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">  </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">→</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120"> </span>3, length(9,10)<span

class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">→</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120"> </span>5).
Nonetheless, we maintain the assumption that rough heuristics helped more than analyzing all
features.
</p><!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >We can only wonder if the speed of password perception is also associated with selection time – are
skilled PASDJO-players capable of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">choosing </span>a password quickly? If users take less time to sign
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
up to a given service, they might be using mental shortcuts to accomplish the tasks.
There is much evidence that contextual cues, the preferred password, or the composition
policy are indeed used as mental shortcuts. Investigating perception speed with selection
speed poses new research questions that have not been addressed in the literature as
such.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.4    </span> <a

<!--l. 318--><p class="noindent" >The learning curves in Figures <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> clearly indicate that players learned assessing password
strength after playing PASDJO. Most notably, players learned to estimate passphrases. Thus, if the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">authority </span>principle succeeded as a persuasive strategy, this might have influenced the users’ mental
model around passphrases. More generally, this finding confirms that mental models of password
strength are not static. Therefore, PASDJO could be actively utilized to educate users about
password strength, especially passphrases. Persuasive interventions could challenge users to
rate the strength of a passphrase in the opportune moment and then debrief users to
correct their mental model. We created such an intervention with our studies on the
Decoy effect (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch10.html#x106-30600010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:decoy --></a>), which indeed show the predicted influence on mental
models.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.5    </span> <a

<!--l. 321--><p class="noindent" >We discussed the most important limitations regarding the methodology in Section <a 
href="#x74-1350005.2.3">5.2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:pasdjo:beneftis_shortcomings_method --></a>.
Therefore, we focus on the limitations in the data and test results in this section.
</p><!--l. 324--><p class="noindent" >From Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>, it is evident that most games were played at special events at the university or
at conferences. Therefore, we can safely assume that our sample consists mostly of
students, their peers, and academics. Thus, we must be careful not to expect the same
strength assessment from other user groups or larger populations. Nonetheless, many
players in our one-year trial might not have a background in cybersecurity and thus, we
are confident that the sample still represents a useful cross-section of a diverse enough
population.
</p><!--l. 327--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, version 2 introduced a number of improvements that would have been nice-to-have
already in the earlier version. Still, in the first version, the different conditions were easier to tell
apart. Thus, causal effects are easier to isolate.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
</p><!--l. 330--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the strength ratings in PASDJO are solely based on zxcbn scores. While it is a
state-of-the-art metric (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-580002.3.3">2.3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:zxcbn --></a>), other metrics might model real-world attacks better in
some situations. For instance, we could have chosen Melicher’s JavaScript implementation of
neural network strength estimation <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">233</a>]</span>. However, it is more challenging to integrate and also
does not map password strength to a scale from 1 to 5, but to a guess number. The same goes for
other estimators. Therefore, it is also not immediately possible to conduct secondary analyses
because players’ coarse ratings are hard to map to fine-grained guess numbers. Nonetheless,
zxcvbn’s assessments correlate strongly with the output from <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PGS">PGS</a>. Therefore, we are confident that
zxcvbn is the best tool for the constraints of our game. In the future, it might be worthwhile to
explore useful solutions to include multiple strength metrics to obtain a more differentiated strength
assessment.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.5    </span> <a 
 id="x74-1580005.5"></a>Summary</h3>
<!--l. 333--><p class="noindent" >In this project, we explored password strength perceptions in a novel approach. Earlier surveys had
shown that users do not always have an accurate understanding of what contributes to the strength
of a password. Rather than conducting a survey, we implemented a novel password game, which
allows for better randomization of the measurements. Moreover, the game has unique
potential to measure learning effects of the players. The source code of PASDJO is openly
available<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss82.html#fn8x16"><sup class="textsuperscript">8</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x74-158001f8"></a>,
so other researchers can adjust the parameters to their own needs. For instance, PASDJO was
customized for a competition as part of a Google-internal event in October 2017.
</p><!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >We contribute insights from a longitudinal field study. Our sample comprises more than
ten thousand strength estimations, which allows for precise analyses. PASDJO players
accurately recognized the strength of commonly used passwords (RQ1). Furthermore,
players largely underestimated the strength of multi-word passphrases, so this was the
most error-prone password topology (RQ2). However, if they went on to play multiple
games, they adjusted their mental model and rated such passphrases higher. This clearly
demonstrates learning effects induced by playing PASDJO. Users were also misled by leet (l33t)
substitutions in otherwise predictable passwords, so they slightly overestimated their strength.
However, all in all, players performed better than anticipated which might be due to the
constellation of the sample. On the other hand, educational efforts from the past decades might
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
have somewhat paid off, which brings us back to our initial motivation and research
objectives: The folk model of a “naive” user seems wrong. Current password meters and
similar feedback systems thus might fail to persuade users because the information they
provide is redundant or well-known. Therefore, we posit that feedback on password
accomodate the fact that people often act deliberately and rationally. For instance, if service
providers aim to persuade users to create a unique passphrase, the benefits need to be more
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">salient </span>and made <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">available</span>. Passphrases are a feasible alternative for master passwords
in password managers, therefore we believe that persuasive techniques are viable for
them.

<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >The game presented in this chapter can be used as-is to answer additional research questions. For
example, it would be very interesting to measure how much playing PASDJO influences actual
password selection. To measure this, participants could be invited to a user study in the lab with a
cover story. Once arrived, they are asked to sit in the waiting area until the experimenter picks them
up again. PASDJO is installed as a demo in the waiting area and there could be a monetary
incentive to “beat the highscore”. Afterwards, they complete a usability test where the focus is
steered away from the sign-up form. In such a study setting, it should be possible to measure
password selection under PASDJO’s short term influence. To study the influence in the wild, the
feature set of the game could be reduced and made part of an oboarding process to a
password manager. If necessary, one could think of another cover story, e.g. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">please wait</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">while we set up your system, you can distract yourself with this tiny game while you</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">wait</span>.
</p><!--l. 340--><p class="noindent" >The game can also evolve in the near future. For instance, players could be taken through a few trial
passwords to make sure everyone has the same understanding of the task. To incentivize
participation, additional game elements like challenges and quests are thinkable. Allowing players
to set up profiles serves the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">personalization </span>principle and also could be used to collect basic
