<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >Passwords are but one puzzle piece in the realm of cyber security. They are part of the access
control paradigm, which is commonly divided into three steps: identification, authentication, and
authorization <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRiley2006IdentityAuthenticationDistinct">268</a>]</span>. Identifying a user is usually done with a prompt for a user name, so the
system first tries to answer the question “who are you?”. Authentication is about proving
that a user – or more broadly an entity – is who they claim to be, i.e. authentication is
about <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">verification of an entity</span>. In other words, the system asks “How can you prove that
you are who you claim to be?”. This verification process can be based on three central
elements, namely something that you know (any kind of secret), something that you
are (any kind of property), or something that you have (any kind of secret token). One
could argue that the second category could be extended by “something that you do”, e.g.
provide your individual signature. However, authentication does not necessarily <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">require</span>
identification as a first step. It is well possible to authenticate entities even if they are
anonymous. One everyday example are passwords for WiFi networks: Most of the time, the
access point does not require a user name; the password, or pre-shared key, in the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:WPA">WPA</a>
protocol is enough to join the network. Last, authorization is the decision over which
resources an authenticated entity is allowed to use, or an answer to “can the user access
this?”.
</p><!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >For this thesis, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">authentication </span>remains the center of attention. In this chapter, we take a
look at various forms of authentication and establish an argument as to why “something
that you know” is still the most prevalent and significant authentication paradigm to
date.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x8-470002.1"></a>A Brief History of Passwords</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The idea of protecting resources with “something that you know” is hundreds of years old. Think
about the magic words “open, Sesame!” that Ali Baba spoke to enter a den used as treasury by forty
thieves<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss9.html#fn1x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-47001f1"></a>.
The story already illustrates password misuse, because Ali Baba was not the rightful owner of the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
den and he impersonated the thieves. Nonetheless, this authentication paradigm was brought
to the digital world in the early 1960s by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT)<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss10.html#fn2x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-47002f2"></a>.
Researchers had built a mainframe computer that was programmable by multiple users. At the time,
one of the most valuable resources beside the physical device was the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">time </span>granted to use the
machine. Thus, the Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS) was conceived to give
every user a certain quota of hours to operate the computer. The quota was enforced with
the aid of dedicated user accounts that were password protected. The interaction very
much resembled what we still use today: after typing the user name, the password is
requested and hidden from the screen during entry to prevent others from observing the
credentials.
</p><!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Shortly afterwards, the flaws of the system started to become evident when Alan Scherr became the first
“hacker”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss11.html#fn3x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-47003f3"></a>.
He desired more usage time, so he needed to impersonate other users of the computer and use their
quota. The list of passwords on the system was not well protected, which allowed him to access the
credentials and carry out what was probably the first password exploit in computer history. Scherr
benefited from the fact that passwords were kept in plain text and could be accessed
with a special punch card. Interestingly the attack was not detected immediately. Morris
and Thompson mention strange behavior in their 1979 paper and blame the issue on
a “software design error” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">237</a>]</span>, while in fact it was Scherr who was responsible for
it<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss12.html#fn4x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">4</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-47004f4"></a>.
With the rise of the UNIX operating system in the 1970s, encrypted passwords became standard.
One of the cornerstones was the Data Encryption Standard (DES) which was developed by IBM
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
and propagated by the US National Bureau of Standards (today called the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a>) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBishop1995ProactivePasswordChecking">25</a>]</span>. This algorithm was widely used until the late 1990s when
computing power was sufficient to efficiently carry out attacks, which rendered DES
infeasible. At the time, the Advanced Encryption Standard had already been proposed
and was able to replace DES in a straightforward manner, so the issue was resolved
quickly.

<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Around 50 years after CTSS, one of its creators, Fernando Corbató, said in an interview with the Wall
Street Journal that password-based authentication has “become kind of a nightmare with the World Wide
Web”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss13.html#fn5x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">5</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-47006f5"></a>.
The surge of the Web has led to many services requiring authentication. Alphanumeric passwords
were the go-to solution because the system is easy to implement and has almost no set-up costs
other than a database. This has led to passwords becoming the de-facto standard for authenticating
users on the Web.
</p><!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >However, passwords do have shortcomings for all the stakeholders involved in the authentication
process, e.g. users who struggle with remembering a multitude of passwords, or <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SP">service providers</a>
who need to deal with leaked passwords (see Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). Consequently, there have been many
attempts to replace passwords as a whole to either minimize security risks, make things easier for
the users, or – ideally – both at the same time. Until now, though, no alternative authentication
mechanism has been able to fully replace alphanumeric passwords on the web, which we
investigate in detail in Section <a 
href="#x8-610002.5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:authentication_without_pws --></a>. Put short, the benefits provided by passwords outweigh the
drawbacks most of the time.

Attacks have since become more sophisticated and manifold (see Figure <span

An adversary tries to impersonate the user by trying different combinations of user names and
passwords, which are sent to the authenticating service directly. If successful, the attacker can log
in without the user noticing and steal personal information, act on their behalf, and try to use the
credentials on other services as well. This attack, which is commonly known as an “online attack”,
is in many cases thwarted by throttling the number of unsuccessful login attempts per account. The
service provider can lock down a user account entirely after a given number of failed
login attempts. Afterwards, the user either has to manually reset their password, or they
need to wait a certain time until the account is unlocked and new login attempts can
be made. In the latter scenario, a strategy to hamper attacks is to implement a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">backoff</span>
algorithm<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss14.html#fn6x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-49001f6"></a>
like, e.g., in the Ethernet protocol <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTanenbaum2011ComputerNetworks">328</a>, p. 285]</span>. The idea behind this scheme is to (exponentially)
increase the time a user (or attacker) has to wait until they can log in again after the account was
locked down. Brostoff and Sasse suggest allowing ten attempts until the account is locked <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrostoff2003TenStrikes">40</a>]</span>.
This should give users enough trials to go through their list of passwords which is usually shorter
than ten <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>]</span>. Though this kind of countermeasure may seem like the best option, for system
providers it comes at a higher price than for users: A malicious party could easily lock out a large
number of users with a denial-of-service attack. For example, if a lockout policy is in place that
invalidates passwords after ten failed login attempts, an attacker would only need to take a list of
email addresses (readily available on the Internet) and run ten or more guesses per user. This
would lock all of them out at once and the financial damage for the service provider to
respond to user requests and/or reactivate accounts manually is probably large. There are
defense strategies for this kind of threat, too, but their success cannot be guaranteed
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">112</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 64--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps, online guessing to access user accounts might only be feasible for determined attackers
who target specific victims, but this type of attack is not entirely uncommon <span class="cite">[<a

It is sometimes argued that such an attacker might automate up to one million guesses until the
attack becomes profitless because it would simply take too long <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2015ImperfectAuthentication">35</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014AdministratorsGuide">115</a>]</span>. However, if login
attempts are not throttled whatsoever, attackers have reasonable chances for payoff. This situation
can lead to massive attacks, like the largest attack on WordPress to date in December

Florêncio et al. argue that users are well advised to pick passwords that can at least
withstand this type of attack, because they stand a reasonable chance to fight them off. On
the other hand, it becomes too difficult to protect themselves against offline guessing

In this scenario an attacker breaks into the server of a service provider, usually by
exploiting security holes. If this goes unnoticed, the intruder can often access
the entire database containing the user account data. He or she downloads the
data to their own machine, which allows them to use cracking tools like John the
Ripper<span class="footnote-mark"><a

or PassFault <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XPaiva2017Passfault">250</a>]</span>. These sophisticated tools use dictionaries, mangling rules and brute force to
calculate password hashes which are then compared to the entry in the database. If the hashes
match, the password was cracked and its plain text version is written to a file. Ideally, the passwords
in the database are cryptographically hardened through salting and a slow hash function like bcrypt
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XProvos1999bcrypt">259</a>]</span>, which drastically reduces an attacker’s chances to crack the password. At the other side of
the attack surface, the passwords could be stored in plain text, which would not require any
cracking automation at all. Unfortunately, some of the most famous data leaks revealed that data
was stored in plain text. The RockYou breach in 2009 contained 32 Million user accounts for its
gaming website with plain-text passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">32</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">365</a>]</span>. At the time, RockYou developed
games for MySpace and Facebook and the database also contained credentials for these
sites<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss19.html#fn11x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-50004f11"></a>,
which made the leak even more severe. Strong passwords would not have helped at all to avoid
losing personal data. Perhaps RockYou’s loose policy (five characters or more, no further
restrictions) helped in safeguarding other accounts where more complex policies were in place,
because users were not able to reuse their RockYou password there. In other instances of stolen
password databases, the passwords were indeed hashed, e.g. the infamous LinkedIn
breaches<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss20.html#fn12x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">12</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-50005f12"></a>
– again with millions of rows of user data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuh2017TooBusy">169</a>]</span>. Users are challenged to find a password that
withstands this kind of attack. The large issue is that attackers are basically only limited by the time
and money they want to spend on calculating password hashes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBlock2017EconomicsOfflineCracking">27</a>]</span>. On modern machines
with a single GPU, thousands of hashes can be calculated per second even for slow

Social engineering has become one of the biggest threats for a user’s passwords with a growing
number of incidents and fierce financial damage <span class="cite">[<a

Put simply, an attacker fools a victim into revealing certain kinds of information, including
passwords. The most common social engineering attack on passwords is phishing, which typically
involves two components: a fraudulent website that mimics another service and an email that lures
the user onto this website <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDhamija2006WhyPhishingWorks">85</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSheng2010WhoFallsForAPhish">301</a>]</span>. The email usually utilizes persuasive techniques like scaring
(“we noticed someone logged into your bank account and you need to reset your password”) or
time pressure (“you need to act <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">now </span>to avoid further damage”). If the website looks just like the
original (like the web pages in Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>), users might fall for it and enter their password to log in.
In that case, it does not matter whether it is a strong, complex password or simply 12345 –
the attacker knows the username/password combination from that point on <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTari2006ShoulderSurfingComparison">329</a>]</span>. If
this tuple is used on other services, the attacker immediately gains access to those as
well.
<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >It is very challenging for users to validate the authenticity of a given webpage <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDhamija2006WhyPhishingWorks">85</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XFogg2001WhatMakesSitesCredible">121</a>]</span>. Usually,
the URL is the best indicator. Dhamjia et al. among others argue that it is unrealistic to keep an eye
on the URL at all times. Since the URL and padlock-icons are often ineffective, much research has
been dedicated to help users in this validation and prevent phishing attacks. For example, Lin et al.
found that domain highlighting in the URL bar only has a small effect on the effectiveness of
phishing attacks, even after their participants were explicitly instructed to take note of the URL
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLin2011DomainHighlighting">212</a>]</span>. Wu et al. showed that browser toolbars do not really help users, either <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWu2006SecurityToolbars">378</a>]</span>. Dhamija et al.
proposed a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">trusted path </span>between the user and the legitimate service <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDhamija2005DynamicSecuritySkins">84</a>]</span>. In this system,
users are supposed to verify the authenticity of a given website by comparing visual
patterns in a trusted window and on the website. Together with Max-Emanuel Maurer and
Alexander De Luca, I created a browser extension to visualize the usage of different
types of SSL certificates <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMaurer2011ShiningChrome">225</a>]</span>. The extension makes the SSL state more obtrusive by
coloring the entire frame of the browser window, e.g., in green if all communication is
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
securely encrypted. The user then does not have to look for a small padlock icon or the
“http<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">s</span>://” URL prefix. We deployed it publicly and launched a feedback survey, which
indicated that changing the browser skins is obtrusive enough to raise awareness and
makes users more confident while browsing the Web. Until the recent change of platform
APIs<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss23.html#fn15x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">15</sup></a></span><a

and resulting incompatibility problems, the extension named “SSLPersonas” had seen
47000 downloads, which is an indicator of both the necessity and the success of our
solution.
</p><!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >However, ideally the browser would detect phishing websites and users from visiting them in the
first place. Current versions of the major browsers try to do this and urge the user to leave the

Secretly stealing plain-text passwords is also possible by infiltrating the user’s system with

keylogger that sends all keyboard input to the attacker. For the most part, this either happens as a
“drive-by-download” when the user visits an infected website or by opening a malicious email
attachment <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBKA2016Bundeslagebild">45</a>]</span>. In the former scenario, the sole line of defense lies with the service provider who
needs to make sure their website is not infected. Wash identified that users are generally aware
of this kind of threat, but their mental model of malware is sub-par <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2010FolkModels">362</a>]</span>. Hence, the
countermeasures taken by the users are often insufficient. As with the phishing scenario, a strong
password is incapable of preventing a malware attack. Ideally, users use an anti-virus
solution, keep their software updated at all times and refrain from opening suspicious email
attachments.
</p><!--l. 137--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, user credentials can be intercepted in transit, e.g. after the user submits them through a
web form. These so called man-in-the-middle attacks are tough to carry out, but strong
passwords do not prevent them either. One of the typical solutions to minimize the risk is
encrypting the traffic with a secure protocol like SSL/TLS <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTanenbaum2011ComputerNetworks">328</a>, p. 853ff.]</span>, which is based
on a public/private key infrastructure. This makes it harder for an adversary to act as
the man in the middle, because they would require the private key of either party. So,
attackers must tamper with the certificates which usually causes browsers to show a
warning <span class="cite">[<a

To obtain the password of a specific user, one can also simply watch them enter it and figure out
what the password was. This attack is typically referred to as “shoulder surfing” because the person
who is watching figuratively “surfs” on the user’s “shoulder” to look at their screen <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTari2006ShoulderSurfingComparison">329</a>]</span>. Shoulder
surfing is relatively easy and does not require technical sophistication. But, although friends and
family can carry out such an attack, it is safe to say that it is more problematic in public spaces
where unknown bystanders are present. Typical interactions that take place in such environments
can be found with PIN entry, e.g. on an ATM, or entering any kind of password on a mobile device,
e.g. on a bus in close vicinity to other people. De Luca et al. dedicated some research to both
scenarios. For instance, they investigated contextual factors during ATM usage and the
design space for alternative ATM authentication mechanisms <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeLuca2010UnderstandingATMSecurity">78</a>]</span>. They developed the
ColorPIN scheme, where numerical input needs to match a previously enrolled color

correct digit (e.g. “1”), and then type a corresponding letter in the right color (e.g. a black
“Q”). A shoulder-surfer is hereby challenged by overwhelming their short-term memory

</p><!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, long alphanumeric passwords are a seldom-researched topic with regard to shoulder
surfing. Shaub et al. looked into the effect of different designs of virtual keyboards on shoulder
surfing susceptibility <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSchaub2012PasswordShoulderSurfing">279</a>]</span>. Somewhat unsurprisingly, they found that keyboards with more
cumbersome access to special characters are less prone to shoulder surfing because it is harder for
an attacker to keep track of the keyboard switches. Moreover, we can see in the ColorPIN
example that PINs and graphical passwords are more likely to be under attack. Users
usually enter graphical passwords more slowly <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTari2006ShoulderSurfingComparison">329</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWiedenbeck2006ConvexHull">373</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2009VisualSnakeOil">265</a>]</span>, which on the one hand
gives an attacker more time to observe, but on the other hand burdens the short-term
memory a bit more. Also, some visual authentication mechanisms require more screen
real estate than a username/password form and entry is often not masked <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBiddle2009GraphicalFirstTwelveYears">23</a>]</span>. Still,
there is not a lot of evidence that observation is a severe threat in the real world, other
than for ATM PINs and any kind of credentials of people of public interest. Herley and
Pieters point out that the attack is not scalable via algorithms <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. Hence, Maguire
and Renaud come to the conclusion that “shoulder-surfing may well be a non-issue in
authentication design” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMaguire2012YouOnlyLiveTwice">218</a>]</span>. Using desktops or laptops to authenticate on regular websites,
observation is rarely a major concern. Passwords are usually masked in the browser by
replacing each character with an asterisk or a bullet symbol. However, masking has
recently been questioned because it prevents proactive error checking on the user side

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Other attacks</span></span>
Apart from the attacks described above, there are other approaches that should not go unmentioned
(see Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). First, people in one’s own social circle, e.g. friends and family, have considerable
amounts of personal information and often physical access to devices and passwords
written onto post-it notes. Although the intent is often not purely malicious, it can be
easy for these people to have an informed guess of a user’s credentials. Flechais et al.
use the term “spouse attack” to describe this kind of threat <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlechais2013SaudiArabiaTrust">109</a>]</span>, Dunphy et al. call it
a “friend attack”, while Sasse and Flechais framed it as “insider attack” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>]</span>. Ur et
al. found that users underestimate its likelihood <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. A strong, complex password
that is only memorable to the legitimate user might help in that scenario. Weirich and
Sasse, however, argue that choosing an overly complex secret could make the user appear
“paranoid” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">368</a>]</span> and Flechais et al. see password sharing as an important sign of trust
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlechais2013SaudiArabiaTrust">109</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlechais2005DivideConquerTrust">110</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >Finally, some credentials are shared unintentionally on the web. Software developers who share
open source code on the web are prone to this issue <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XConklin2004PWAuthenticationSystemPerspective">59</a>]</span>. Recently, the node package
manager (npm) platform realized that many of its users published their passwords with the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
packages<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss26.html#fn18x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">18</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-54001f18"></a>.
An adversary could simply crawl public repositories on GitHub and collect the passwords in plain
text. The npmjs.org operators had to invalidate the credentials to secure the accounts. One solution
that reduces the severity of credential loss is using multi-factor authentication (cf. Section
<a 
href="#x8-710002.5.3">2.5.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:shared_auth_tokens --></a>).

strategy-specific methods which can efficiently guess the passwords” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYang2016MnemonicSentenceBased">381</a>]</span>. Economists call this
the “Tragedy of the Commons” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHardin1968TragedyCommons">156</a>]</span>. For example, shifts in password practices imply that if
passphrases (cf. Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1040003.3.3">3.3.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:passphrases --></a>) do become commonplace, attackers will optimize their attack
strategy, rendering the well-intended efforts to strengthen passwords less effective. Consequently,
the challenge of considering such effects and realistically measuring password strength has sparked
some discussion, which has led to a small set of suitable models which are discussed
below.

<!--l. 203--><p class="noindent" >In 1951, Claude Shannon put forward an information-theoretical approach that describes the
encoding of English letters and words <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShannon1951Entropy">292</a>]</span>. In it, he defines the term “entropy” as “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">a statistical</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">parameter, which measures [...] how much information is produced on the average for each letter of</span>

<span

<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">language</span>”. In other words, entropy represents the amount of information of a given word in
bits.
</p><!--l. 206--><p class="noindent" >William (Bill) Burr and his colleagues at <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a> took to this understanding and translated it into a
measure for password strength, which was officially published for the first time in 2004 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBurr2004NISTEntropy">47</a>,
Appendix A]</span>. They define “guessing-entropy” as “an estimate of the average amount of work
required to guess the password of a selected user”. Apart from guessing a single user’s password,
the macro perspective defines the “min-entropy” as “a measure of the difficulty of guessing the
easiest single password to guess in the population”. Although many citing publications (e.g.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">32</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>) do not sufficiently point it out, Burr et al. explicitly acknowledge the limitation of using
entropy as metric for user-selected passwords. They base their estimate on frequency
distributions, meaning more frequently used passwords are guessed first and are thus lower in
entropy.
</p><!--l. 209--><p class="noindent" >For random passwords, the <a

kind of entropy calculation is rarely realistic. In other words, the effective or practical password
space is much smaller than the theoretical password space. The original <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a> guideline tries to
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
take this into account and gives another calculation approach based on user behavior (see page 49f.
in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBurr2004NISTEntropy">47</a>]</span>). It lists a few entropy heuristics, e.g. the first character gives 4 bits of entropy, the next 7
characters add 2 bits of entropy each, while the 9th through 20th character only add 1.5 bits.
Burr et al. do not provide a formal rationale as to why this was chosen. But again, the
publication specifically points out that this is still an inaccurate approach because this
would require “examining in detail the passwords that users actually select under the
rules of the password system”. Moreover, they admitted that “NIST would like to obtain
more data on the passwords users actually choose, but, where they have the data, system
administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others”. In the meantime,
however, there have been many data leaks which fill this hole (see Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> in the following
chapter).

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x8-570002.3.2"></a>Guess Numbers: Markov Models, PCFGs, and Neural Networks</h4>
<!--l. 221--><p class="noindent" >Using such leaked data, Weir et al. developed a cracking method based on probabilistic context free
grammar (PCFG) in 2009 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2009PCFG">366</a>]</span>. The idea behind PCFG is that passwords often follow a rather
predictable scheme (e.g. a word followed by a sequence of digits and an exclamation mark,
see Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-920003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:user-behavior --></a>). One can model such patterns with so-called mangling rules. Weir et
al.’s approach was to find a set of mangling rules that crack the most passwords in a
given data set. A mangling rule takes a certain password input and creates one or more
alternative versions of it, for instance the rule could be to replace all occurrences of
the letter “s” with the “$” symbol (password would become pa$$word). The ultimate
goal is to minimize the number of guesses to crack passwords. Mangling rules also are
essential for password cracking software like John the Ripper or Hashcat, but those tools
primarily use them to generate word-lists, and not for guessing-order optimization. Veras
et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVeras2014SemanticPatterns">348</a>]</span>, as well as Komanduri extended Weir et al.’s PCFG approach afterwards
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2016Dissertation">198</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 224--><p class="noindent" >A year later, Weir et al. evaluated the usage of the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a> entropy formulae against real-world
passwords and policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">365</a>]</span> to address the issues pointed out by Burr et al. For the evaluation, they
performed guessing attacks with PCFG on leaked password sets (most notably RockYou). For
comparison, they calculated the NIST entropy for each password and correlated it with cracking
success rates. Their analyses show that the calculated entropies were not satisfyingly
predictive of cracking success, and they concluded that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">“there is no way to convert the notion</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">of Shannon entropy into the guessing entropy of password creation policies”</span>. Weir et
al. thus proposed “guessing probability” as a more accurate password strength metric
and the result of an analysis is a kind of lookup-table split into different probability
groups.
</p><!--l. 228--><p class="noindent" >Since the computing power required to perform the PCFG attack was relatively high, Kelley et al.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
tried to improve the algorithm by testing multiple training sets and variations of guess algorithms
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKelley2012GuessAgain">190</a>]</span>. They used the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a> platform to collect new passwords created under different policies
(more on policies in Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1000003.3.1">3.3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:policies --></a>) and tried to crack them. Tuning the right parameters for
cracking by exploiting a priori knowledge (e.g. password policy) led to much more cost-efficient
analyses, but the training still takes approximately 24 hours. However, once the Markov-chain
model is generated, one can simply pass in any kind of password and retrieve its <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">guess number</span>. The
higher the guess number, the stronger it is. After a certain threshold, the password is
considered unguessable – which is also one of the limitations of the approach because given
the time and resources virtually anything can be cracked. Kelley et al.’s approach soon
became a gold standard to measure password strength, especially at <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:CMU">Carnegie Mellon
University (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA) (CMU)</a>. Komanduri et al. were probably the
last ones in 2011 that still used entropy as strength metric <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>. Kelley et al.’s guess
numbers caught on and are still used today, perhaps because they directly represent
the <span

Carnavalet put it <span

<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">48</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 231--><p class="noindent" >Almost simultaneously to Kelley et al., Bonneau developed his idea of efficient and effective
guessing, which has also generated a lot of impact since then <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">32</a>]</span>. He collected leaked passwords
and tried to attack them in different ways to find patterns in user behavior that could be leveraged in
real-world attacks. Fundamentally, the attacks differ in the choice of dictionaries. He found
that the success rates strongly depend on the dictionary that is used for it. He aimed to
translate his findings to a new entropy paradigm and concluded that 10 bits of entropy
are probably enough to defend against online attacks, respectively 20 bits for offline
attacks.
</p><!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" >Ur et al. took guessing to the next level by evaluating the most sophisticated approaches to date
against each other <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015MeasuringRealWorldAccuracies">346</a>]</span>. They compared the performance of John the Ripper, Hashcat/oclHashcat,
Markov chains/PCFG and professional password recovery companies. Moreover, they tested
several configurations of the tools and checked their guess success rates for passwords created
under different password policies. They concluded that a multi-tiered approach is capable of giving
the most conservative metric for password strength. One of the major contributions of their
work is the Password Guessability Service (PGS) that they have begun offering to the
community<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss28.html#fn20x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">20</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-57001f20"></a>.
After successful registration, researchers can upload a file containing plain-text passwords, e.g.
after collecting them through a user study (cf. Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-770003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:methodology --></a>). The user has to provide a few additional
parameters, like the policy that was utilized, which enhances the guessing efficiency and reliability.
Then a set of cracking approaches are run in parallel and the analysis is sent back to the uploader.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
Although this has become an established, state-of-the art tool which has already been used
in numerous publications (e.g., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGross2016CognitiveDepletion">142</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>, <a

href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">369</a>]</span>), it does not come
without caveats. First, passwords need to be uploaded in plain text. This entails a more
careful handling and storage if they originate from a user study, because participants
might in fact have provided their real-world passwords (see <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-770003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:methodology --></a>). Plain-text passwords
also imply that users disclosed them somehow and the mere act of disclosing might
already reduce the strength of passwords, which is not factored into the guess numbers.
However, the team at CMU counteracts this problem by deleting uploads after at most two
weeks. Besides, the analyses are time-consuming, and obtaining results can in fact take
several weeks, because the system is shared with other users. Moreover, if a study aims to
compare multiple password policies, each condition needs to be separately uploaded and
subsequently analyzed. Finally, in personal conversations with the research team, they
pointed out that certain unicode characters are not supported. This makes it infeasible for
passwords that were collected in countries whose languages heavily use umlauts (ä,ö,ü).
Nevertheless, it appears to be one of the best strength proxies the community possesses at the
moment.
</p><!--l. 239--><p class="noindent" >A rather novel approach that has not been integrated into the PGS are cracking algorithms based on
neural networks. Melicher et al. demonstrated an opportunity to configure such algorithms to
perform better than former state-of-the-art techniques like PCFG and Markov models
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">233</a>]</span>. They implemented neural networks based on Monte-Carlo simulations, i.e. “smart
sampling” (cf. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDellamico2015MonteCarlo">82</a>]</span>). A thorough evaluation against PCFG, Markov-models, and word-list
crackers showed that neural networks can outperform all of them if properly trained.
Moreover, Melicher et al. were also able to implement their approach in JavaScript.
This highlights one major advantage of using neural networks: once the model has been
trained, it can be packaged and shipped to browsers, which only requires a few hundred
kilobytes. They showed that this type of client-side strength estimation fares really well.
One caveat is that the solution does not work “out of the box”. Developers have to train
their models and this means that faulty configurations might lead to erroneous strength
estimations.

date and other lightweight strength estimators. Beyond the online-attack threshold, the
results are mixed, but adding more tokens to the dictionary further improves robustness.

One of the advantages of zxcvbn is that its implementation is fairly small (1.5 Megabytes in total).
It comes with 100,000 tokens which allows zxcvbn to conservatively estimate the guess
numbers. Moreover, it can be extended with site-specific word-lists. Zxcvbn performs its
calculations within milliseconds, which makes it suitable to run strength analyses on
the client. This is a major advantage, e.g., to provide users with real-time feedback on
password strength. Moreover, it can also be easily used on the server to enforce more
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
advanced password policies, e.g. with NodeJS. Since zxcvbn is open-source, one can
modify and adapt it to meet context-dependent requirements. This makes it extremely
useful for user studies: One can strip sensitive information from the analysis and save
zxcvbn’s output straight to a database, which is ethically reasonable and speeds up further
analyses.
</p><!--l. 260--><p class="noindent" >Despite the benefits, one needs to be aware of zxcvbn’s drawbacks. Carnavalet compared
several real-world password strength estimators, one of which was zxcvbn v2.x <span class="cite">[<a

Although they concluded that zxcvbn was the best of the tested estimators, they see
the major limitation in the static dictionary size. Zxcvbn ships with index terms from
the English Wikipedia, English words from TV and movie subtitles, a list of roughly
47000 frequency-ranked passwords, female and male first names, and surnames from
English-speaking countries. Hence, all words that cannot be matched from these wordlists
including mangling rules, are seen as random strings. Zxcvbn goes on to assume these can only be
cracked by brute force, but real-world attackers possessing a priori knowledge of the target
population might find ways to guess these passwords more efficiently. However, Melicher

Until now, they have not seen significant attention in the community nor by the industry. Perhaps
their success is a bit hampered because they do not provide a straight-forward interpretable

 id="x8-600002.4"></a>What is a “Bad” Password?</h3>
<!--l. 276--><p class="noindent" >Having looked at strength metrics, it is fair to ask what exactly a “bad” password is. Unfortunately,
the question is more or less impossible to answer, especially without context. The word “bad” is
judgmental on its own and depends on whom is asked. A security expert might call a password
“bad” if it only contains lowercase letters because she knows how to crack such passwords, but a
regular mainstream user might call it “bad” because he cannot type it quickly enough or keeps
forgetting it. So, “bad” depends on one’s own standards, knowledge, beliefs, preferences, and usage
context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGaw2005ReuseRecycle">132</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>. There is a fine difference between the adjective pairs “good”-”bad” and
“strong”-“weak”. A weak password might still be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">good</span>, when it fits the purpose, i.e. when it is
good <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">enough</span>. For example, four-digit PINs are widely used to authenticate at ATMs.
Theoretically, there are only 10000 possible combinations, which could be brute-forced
within milliseconds. Still, the second factor (banking card) and lock-down mechanisms
after a certain number of attempts effectively prevent such attacks, so PINs are <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">good</span>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">enough </span>for the purpose. As another example, a user might choose a dictionary word like
“<span 
class="ectt-1200">spacetime</span>” to sign up for an online forum. If they do not reuse this password for a
more important service like accessing emails, the seemingly weak password might still
be <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">good enough </span>for this purpose. Zhang-Kennedy et al. <span class="cite">[<a

beginning of a range of new authentication schemes: Graphical (or visual) authentication. The
patent presented a mechanism that prompts the user to prove their identity through correctly
clicking a number of locations in an image. His goal was to find an alternative to text-based
passwords that is easier to remember, without losing security benefits <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBiddle2009GraphicalFirstTwelveYears">23</a>, <a

an episode that serves as mnemonic device <span class="cite">[<a

benefits of graphical authentication. For instance, Chiasson et al. report on a lab study which
showed that graphical passwords are easier to remember and less error-prone in the
short term <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2009InterferencesGraphical">52</a>]</span>. In the long term, however, there was no significant difference to textual
passwords. Elizabeth Stobert, who dedicated a large part of her PhD work to graphical
passwords <span class="cite">[<a

there are other advantages like personalization and tailoring schemes to specific user
groups. Imran found that graphical passwords are easily understood by children <span class="cite">[<a

system is a paragon in this domain (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). The user is challenged with identifying the picture of
a person in a grid of nine pictures of people. To increase security, this challenge is executed three times
in a row<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss32.html#fn24x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">24</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-63002f24"></a>.
The three images the user needs to identify were chosen beforehand in the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">enrollment </span>stage.
Brostoff and Sasse, found in a field study that users were able to log in with Passfaces even after a
long period of inactivity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrostoff2000PassfacesEvaluation">41</a>]</span>. However, they also report that participants spoke unfavorably of
Passfaces, because of the increased authentication time. By random guessing, an attacker would
have a chance of <img

Davis et al., however, found that user selection of Passfaces is predictable, thus reducing the
effective password space <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDavis2004UserChoiceGraphical">70</a>]</span>. Dunphy et al. created a mechanism that is based on photos
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDunphy2010CloserLookGraphical">88</a>]</span>. In a two-week field trial they found that participants successfully authenticated
in 77% of attempts, and human attackers needed between 4.5 and 7.5 observations to
shoulder-surf the passwords. These numbers would need to be higher to justify more widespread
adoption.
</p><!--l. 314--><p class="noindent" >Dhamija and Perrig created a similar mechanism called “Déjà Vu” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDhamija2000DejaVu">83</a>]</span>, where the user selects a
number of random-art images instead of faces (see Figure <a 
href="#x8-63004r1">2.4a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:rw:searchmetric:dejavu --></a>). Although participants in a lab
study generally liked Déjà Vu, the system was never adopted on larger scope. Another alternative
solution to using faces is the visual identification protocol (VIP), which is based on pictures of
objects (see Figure <a 
href="#x8-63007r4">2.4d<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:rw:searchmetric:vip --></a>) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeAngeli2002VIP">71</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeAngeli2005PictureThousandWords">72</a>]</span>. De Angeli et al. iteratively improved the prototype, and found
that recognizing six simple and concrete objects worked best, but was still much slower than
entering a PIN. Bicakci et al. also explored authenticating through clicking a sequence of icons as
master password for a password manager (iPMAN) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBicakci2011PWMIconBased">22</a>]</span>. They found that some icons were more
attractive than others and thus impaired security. An icon-based mechanism that strongly
focuses on mitigating shoulder-surfing is Wiedenbeck et al.’s Convex-Hull-Click (CHC)
system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWiedenbeck2006ConvexHull">373</a>]</span>. The challenge set consists of icons which are randomly distributed in the
grid. The idea behind CHC is that the user does not click on their enrolled icons, but
anywhere inside the convex-hull which is formed by the icons. In other words, the user
clicks a random icon within the virtual polygon that is formed by the icons if they were
connected by straight lines. Wiedenbeck et al. showed that CHC has security benefits,
but the large grid of icons negatively impacted authentication times. Moreover, Golla
et al., respectively Kraus et al. recently evaluated emojis instead of PINs for mobile
phones (see Figure <a 
href="#x8-63005r2">2.4b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:rw:searchmetric:emojiauth --></a>) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGolla2017EmojiAuth">136</a>, <a

the legitimate user would be able to make sense of the distorted images and recognize
the original picture, while an attacker can only randomly guess. Across all conditions
of their user study, most participants were able to log in successfully even after four
weeks. Only those who were given a system-assigned portfolio of images were slightly
more troubled. Although the system was never adopted in real-world authentication, it
sparked further ideas to leverage people’s abilities to recognize distorted images <span class="cite">[<a

If the user needs to authenticate by clicking specific points in a challenge image (rather than a
challenge <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">set</span>), the mechanism can be classified as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">locimetric system</span>, from Latin <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">locus </span>= place,
position. Blonder’s patent application <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBlonder1996PatentGraphicalPW">29</a>]</span> is a classical example. Wiedenbeck et al. evaluated
PassPoints, which in essence is one possible implementation of Blonder’s idea <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWiedenbeck2005PassPoints">372</a>]</span>. Security-wise
there were benefits over alphanumeric passwords, but usability results were mixed. Chiasson et al.
combined the PassPoints and Passfaces approaches with the Cued Click Point (CCP) scheme <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2007CCP">54</a>]</span>,
and the Persuasive Cued Click Point scheme <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2008PCCP">51</a>]</span> (CCP). To authenticate, the user has to click a
specific point inside an image (cf. PassPoints) for a sequence of images (cf. Passfaces). The
PCCP version tries to nudge the user to pick less predictable locations (one result of the
CCP-study), which is supposed to further increase the “strength” of the graphical password.
Success rates for log-ins were high, but there was no possibility to correct an error, so
participants in the lab study had to start over. Perhaps, this is a caveat in terms of real-world
adoption. Since alphanumerical passwords do have their advantages, Forget et al. later
suggested allowing the user to pick the authentication scheme that best fits their current
context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2015CYOA">125</a>]</span>. Object Passtiles (OPT, another implementation variant of VIP) and PCCP
were the two available graphical authentication schemes. Interestingly, after the study
participants had tried out a graphical scheme, they later switched back to text-based
passwords.

 id="x8-650002.5.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Drawmetric Systems</span></span>
A third category of graphical authentication are drawmetric systems (also known as recall-based
systems). Here, the user has to either draw a shape configured during enrollment, or perform a
gesture as a kind of virtual drawing. At this point, this is by far the most successful graphical
authentication paradigm, because one such implementation – “pattern unlock” – was added to the
Android operating system already in its early days (see Figure <a 
href="#x8-65002r2">2.6b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:rw:drawmetric:patternunlock --></a>) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAviv2010SmudgeAttacks">15</a>]</span>. The idea of drawmetrics
most likely has its origins in the Draw-a-Secret (DAS) scheme by Jermyn et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XJermyn1999DrawASecret">180</a>]</span>.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
The user is asked to create a secret drawing in a grid of 16 cells (see Figure <a 
href="#x8-65001r1">2.6a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:rw:drawmetric:drawasecret --></a>). The
system maps the drawing to simple <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">(x,y) </span>coordinate-pair sequences, but the password
space, as disseminated by Jermyn et al. is large enough to provide sufficient protection of
handheld devices. Dunphy et al. later aimed to improve the memorability of the drawn
shapes and extended Draw-A-Secret with translucent background images <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDunphy2007BDAS">89</a>]</span>. In a small
lab study they observed no striking memorability nor security benefits. Sherman et al.
removed the grid and let the user authenticate with free-form multi-touch gestures, which
required a more sophisticated matching process <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSherman2014UserGeneratedGesturesAuth">302</a>]</span>. This may be part of the reason
the system had equal error rates (EERs) between 3.34 % and 15.97%. The latter case
means that a legitimate user would enter their gesture correctly and not be granted access
in <img 
src="diss6x.png" alt="˜
1  "  class="tilde"  />6% of attempts, while an adversary would gain access just as likely. This makes
the approach rather unsuitable for usage outside the lab. Another hybrid approach that
combines drawmetric with searchmetric authentication is Schlöglhofer and Sametinger’s
GesturePuzzle <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSchloglhofer2012SecureAndUsableMobileAuth">280</a>]</span>. As the name indicates, the authentication is based on a puzzle: upon
a challenge set of images, from which the user has to recognize the ones from their
portfolio, the user enters a gesture that corresponds to combination of images. Solving this
puzzle appears too demanding on the user’s skills and patience to be adopted on larger
scale.

<!--l. 371--><p class="noindent" >However, once pattern unlock on Android had become a standard authentication technique for
millions of users, a number of formal evaluations were carried out by the academic community.
Harbach et al. pointed out that participants in their longitudinal study spent around 2.8 minutes on
average per day to unlock their phone <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>. Interestingly, patterns were entered significantly
faster than traditional PINs on average. Regarding their proneness to attacks, it was
recognized early that grid-based patterns on a touchscreen are also prone to “smudge
attacks” where attackers can restore the user’s pattern by looking at the oily residue left on
touchscreens after entering the pattern <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAviv2010SmudgeAttacks">15</a>]</span>. De Luca et al. conceived an approach to
authenticate on the back of smartphones and iterated the concept <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeLuca2013BackOfDevice">79</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeLuca2014NowYouSeeMe">76</a>]</span>. Authenticating
on the back has the big advantage to be resilient against shoulder-surfing attacks. Von
Zezschwitz et al. also investigated which specific pattern types were most resilient to
shoulder-surfing even if the attacker can observe them directly <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2015EasyToDraw">356</a>]</span>. Since the pattern unlock on
Android cannot include a given dot multiple times, Colley et al. extended it that way
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XColley2016ExtendingPatterns">58</a>]</span>. This approach effectively thwarts smudge attacks with a minimal change to the
existing system. Moreover, Uellenbeck et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUellenbeck2013QuantifyingSecurityPatterns">340</a>]</span>, as well as Von Zezschwitz et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2016QuantifyingEffective">357</a>]</span>
quantified the effective pattern space. They both concluded that user-chosen patterns are very
predictable, so the hypothesized security benefits of patterns over PINs are questionable. At the
same time, Von Zezschwitz et al. tried to nudge users to pick a less predictable starting
position with different types of background images <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2016QuantifyingEffective">357</a>]</span>. Their approach resembled
Background-Draw-a-Secret (BDAS) <span class="cite">[<a

evaluating the concept through an online study, the effects on user selected patterns, however,
remained small.

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Summary and Future Directions</span></span>
Apart from the pattern unlock for on Android, graphical authentication systems have not been
adopted widely. Text-passwords are still the preferred option for many service providers and are
still available as authentication method on mobile devices. Maybe we need an improved
understanding as to why the supposed advantages of greater memorability and security have not
been able to outweigh the disadvantages (authentication times, shoulder surfing). As of
now, little is known about the mental models of graphical password security. A step in
this direction was Katsini et al.’s recent work <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKatsini2017StrategiesGraphicalPasswords">187</a>]</span>. They explored mental models and
strategies that users employ to create graphical passwords. Thorpe et al. also found out
that there are presentation effects that influence how people pick graphical passwords
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XThorpe2014PresentationEffects">334</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 384--><p class="noindent" >For the future, we could narrow down the most feasible direction for visual authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBiddle2009GraphicalFirstTwelveYears">23</a>]</span>. To
get there, Stobert and Biddle compared searchmetric, locimetric and drawmetric systems in terms
of password memorability <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2013GraphicalPasswords">314</a>]</span>. All participants in their study were assigned a system-generated
password to reduce biases. Unsurprisingly, recognition based systems performed better than recall
based systems (“recognition rather than recall is one of the most important usability heuristics
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XNielsen1994EnhancingHeuristics">242</a>]</span>). Nonetheless, this seems to be the most feasible approach that might see new ideas in the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
near future. However, De Angeli and Renaud et al. doubt that visual authentication methods
will prevail in the long run <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeAngeli2005PictureThousandWords">72</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2009VisualSnakeOil">265</a>]</span>. They argue that the promise of more memorable
passwords has not been fulfilled by the approaches so far and that we should keep looking
elsewhere. Potentially, we will rely on less knowledge-based authentication in the future, but
more on biometric and multimodal approaches. Those are discussed in the following
section.

it, is essentially to “authenticate mobile users based on actions they would carry out

is fairly usable and reasonably secure. However, a wet surface, grease, or dirt can limit the
functionality <span class="cite">[<a

the vicinity (like fingerprint spoofing with a 2D/3D print). Such attacks are becoming
easier to carry out, though they still require decent effort <span class="cite">[<a

the victim is asleep, it is enough to hold the finger onto the sensor to gain access to

(2014)<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss38.html#fn30x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">30</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-68004f30"></a>.
Moreover, on the iPhone X (2017), Apple has removed the home button
and with it the fingerprint reader and the TouchID system in favor of
FaceID<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss39.html#fn31x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">31</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-68005f31"></a>.
With FaceID, the user simply picks up the phone and looks at it to unlock it. The chance of another
person unlocking the phone the same way is 1 to 1 Million, according to Apple. However, it is
possible to fool face-unlock systems with different spoofing attacks like using a face
mask<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss40.html#fn32x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">32</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-68006f32"></a>, or
in some cases a simple image of the legimitate user. All the aforementioned systems use a
PIN/passcode as fallback method that dominates the biometric schemes. De Luca et al. evaluated
the reasons for (not) using biometric authentication on mobile devices in an online survey <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeLuca2015Selfies">75</a>]</span>.
They found that users prioritize usability over security when deciding which unlock mechanism to
use. The respondents who had deactivated Face Unlock mostly did so for usability (read:
interaction times) and reliability reasons. Interestingly, most respondents were aware of the security
trade-off that face recognition entails.

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">voice recognition </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAleksic2006AVBiometrics">10</a>]</span>. Android
and Google Home are among the few consumer-oriented systems that allow users to
authenticate through their voice. Hang et al. evaluated a password reset system that uses
voice recognition to verify the reset request <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHang2013TravelRoutes">152</a>]</span>. They point out the importance of
considering embarrassment in the design of natural voice interaction, e.g. in an office
environment. Moreover, “[b]oth face and voice recognition logins are extremely
situational dependent; [...] speaking into a microphone doesn’t always work in noisy

so it is important to create systems that adapt to specific contexts <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 415--><p class="noindent" >Implicit authentication is done without prompting or challenging the user by continuously verifying
his or her identity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XPeisert2013PriciplesAuthentication">254</a>]</span>. One goal is to achieve a more natural interaction, similar to human-human
interaction. Greenstadt and Beal postulate a system that recognizes people like humans do: “in most
everyday interactions, we recognize people by who they are and how they behave, rather
than by the secrets that they know” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGreenstadt2008CognitiveSecurity">141</a>]</span>. Of course, this excludes situations where two
strangers need to authenticate one another, e.g. at a passport control at the border. A
specific key benefit of successful implicit authentication would be that users do not have to
spend time authenticating explicitly, which can save them a couple of minutes per day
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 418--><p class="noindent" >The way a person walks is one of the features that can be used to recognize them, which humans
also rely upon <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCutting1977GaitPerception">65</a>]</span>. One of the early approaches to exploit gait patterns for authentication can be
traced back to Ailisto et al. who equipped laptop computers with accelerometers <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAilisto2005GaitPatternAccelerometers">7</a>]</span>. They
successfully identified users this way with an EER of 6.5%. Tamviruzzaman et al. implemented this
approach for mobile phones that at the time (2009) had started to integrate acceleration sensors and
gyroscopes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTamviruzzaman2009ePet">327</a>]</span>. For their “ePet” system, they also combined gait patterns with GPS-location
traces, but did not report on a user study. Muaaz and Mayrhofer tackled the issue of device
orientation and achieved an EER of 7.05% in the same study session, but only 18.96% across
multiple sessions. As of now, gait recognition has not been widely adopted, but Android allows the
user to activate “on body detection”, which keeps the device unlocked while it is in
motion<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss42.html#fn34x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">34</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-69001f34"></a>.
The documentation says that “some devices” can learn the gait pattern and lock the device if they
detect a different walking style. As shown in Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>, gait detection faces a number of problems
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
which are difficult to overcome.
</p><!--l. 422--><p class="noindent" >Another theme in implicit authentication is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">behavioral </span>biometrics. For instance, the way people use
their mobile phones and in which contexts can be used to build a user model <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XJakobsson2009ImplicitAuthentication">178</a>]</span>. Keystroke
dynamics, i.e., characteristic typing patterns, can serve as feature. The first algorithms were
conceived for desktop environments <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCrawford2010KeystrokeDynamics">63</a>]</span>, but Bouchoux and Clarke proposed an early solution in
2008 that achieves authentication via keystrokes on smartphones <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBuchoux2008KeystrokeAnalysis">44</a>]</span>. They state that explicitly
enrolling users might be too bothersome for them, so it should be possible to enroll a user
implicitly. This in turn produces a risk of including data from impostors, too. De Luca
showed that users enter grid-based patterns in a unique way, which can be leveraged for
implicit authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeLuca2012TouchMeOnce">74</a>]</span>. Their second user study focused on this type of unlock
mechanism and, with an average accuracy above 90%, they could decide whether a correctly
entered pattern was actually entered by the legitimate user. Interestingly, at the time of
writing this thesis, De Luca et al.’s paper is the most-cited CHI publication in the past five
years<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss43.html#fn35x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">35</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-69002f35"></a>,
which highlights the impact and potential of this approach. What is more, this is one of the few
approaches that makes explicit authentication more secure through a second, biometric layer. While
the user models of the aforementioned approaches are created and maintained on the
devices, Nauman and Ali proposed a system architecture that shifts keystroke analysis
to a Trusted Third Party, which authenticates the user <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XNauman2010TOKEN">240</a>]</span>. However, their approach
requires more sophisticated hardware (trusted platform modules), which renders it more
costly.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x8-700002.5.2"></a>Summary and Outlook</h5>
<!--l. 426--><p class="noindent" >Since all biometric features, if considered independently, can be spoofed in some way (see Table
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>), approaches to combine multiple features have started to proliferate. Although the idea of
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">multimodal </span>signals for authentication is not particularly new (some implementations were done in
the mid 1990s <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrunelli1995PersonIdentificationMultipleCues">43</a>]</span>), perhaps the computing power both on the clients and back-ends is now large
enough to handle the input streams. Bigun et al. developed a framework that continues to learn
from multiple signals <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBigun2005CombiningBiometricEvidence">24</a>]</span>, which requires such computing power. Rybinicek et al. presented
a roadmap with obstacles and opportunities <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRybnicek2014RoadmapContinuousAuth">274</a>]</span> that can serve the design of future
multimodal biometric authentication schemes. Google, among other companies, tries to
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
incorporate the notion of such multimodal implicit authentication in their Smart Lock
solution<span class="footnote-mark"><a

</p><!--l. 428--><p class="noindent" >In summary, we can take away that biometric authentication provides many usability benefits like
reduced time spent on authentication and also security enhancements. Though implicit
authentication is unlikely to replace explicit authentication completely, it can still make explicit
schemes more secure as demonstrated by De Luca et al. <span class="cite">[<a

why biometrics are still dominated by knowledge based authentication especially in situations
where the system cannot make a final decision due to low certainty.

not necessarily aim to replace passwords, but to make them more user-friendly and/or
secure.

 id="x8-720002.5.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Two-Factor Authentication</span></span>
In multi-factor authentication, the user needs to present multiple credentials
to the system in whichever form. For instance, the Google 2-step verification
mechanism combines the user-chosen password with a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">one-time password</span>
(OTP)<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss45.html#fn37x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">37</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-72001f37"></a>.
If users log into their Google account on a computer in an Internet café, they will receive an OTP
on a secondary device, usually inside a text message sent to their personal phone. If no more than
two separate channels (“<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">out of band authentication</span>”, OOBA) are involved, the scheme is usually
referred to as Two-factor authentication or 2FA for short. Multi-factor authentication aims to
prevent impersonation in case an attacker has obtained a victim’s primary credential, but not their
secondary factor. There were hints to combining multiple such levels to make authentication more
robust already in the late 1970s. Morris and Thompson mentioned that “some UNIX systems have
instituted what is called an ‘external security code’ that must be typed when dialing into the system,
but before logging in. If this code is changed periodically, then someone with an old
password will likely be prevented from using it [the system, author’s note]” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">237</a>]</span>. Moreover,
Haskett shared an idea about a second level of authentication in 1984 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaskett1984PassAlgorithms">157</a>]</span>. With the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Pass-Algorithms </span>mechanism, the user first authenticates with their regular credentials and then
proves their identity by responding to a random prompt by completing a pre-shared
procedure. The algorithm is altered by the system administrator and then shared with the
legitimate users, who are supposed to memorize the algorithm rather than a static password.
For instance, the current algorithm could be to use the subsequent letter in the alphabet
based on the challenge: If the challenge is BEL, the user enters CFM as second layer of
authentication. The proposed benefit is that the algorithm is easier to remember and can
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
still be personalized. Multi-factor authentication has since been widely adopted and
more web services are following. Many banks have the users confirm transactions by a
transaction number (TAN) sent to their phones, although they are already logged in
with their banking password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMaurer2011DataTypeWarnings">224</a>]</span>. The primary benefit of multi-factor authentication
lies in the increased confidence of the legitimacy of account actions. In any case, there
is a small usability caveat, because adding more factors leads to longer interactions,
which is not recommendable for secondary tasks like authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. However, the
increased security might in turn improve user experience because it also reassures users that
they are interacting with the legitimate party. Attacks on multi-factor authentication are
possible<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss46.html#fn38x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">38</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-72002f38"></a>,
but do not scale well <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2014CybercrimeAtScale">163</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 448--><p class="noindent" >Moreover,  one-time  passwords  and  “Magic  Login
Links”<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss47.html#fn39x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">39</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-72003f39"></a>
can also replace user-chosen passwords. The user only provides their user name, and the system
sends them a magic link or a random one-time password to their verified email account or phone.
So, in that sense, accessing one’s personal email account is the primary authentication factor. After
clicking the link or logging in with the OTP, the link or OTP expires. If implemented at scale, this
could allow users to only memorize the credentials for their email account and log in to all other
systems by receiving magic links. However, the approach is only secure under the assumption that
the email account is well protected. It might be fair to assume that users might underestimate
the risk of relying on magic links. For low-value accounts, it seems like a viable and
promising solution, although trust issues on the user side need to be further addressed

Hardware tokens are often a special flavor of multi-factor authentication, but it
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
is worthwhile to treat them separately, because in some cases they can act as
standalone replacement of passwords, too. In general, this solution uses a hardware
device to store user secrets <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">34</a>]</span>. In multi-factor environments, the RSA SecurID
token<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss48.html#fn40x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">40</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-73001f40"></a> displays
a random numerical which is valid for at most 60 seconds, and the user has to enter it as second factor. The
YubiKey tokens<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss49.html#fn41x3"><sup class="textsuperscript">41</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x8-73002f41"></a>
are inserted into the USB port of the computer or held against an NFC-equipped smartphone to
prove the user’s identity (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). While the two devices improve account protection, the
downside is that they are easily lost or stolen, and have to be with the user when they need to
authenticate.
</p><!--l. 454--><p class="noindent" >To save users from entering PINs, patterns, or passwords to unlock their phones, Jakobsson
developed a bracelet that serves as a secure token <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XJakobsson2014HowToWearYourPW">176</a>]</span>, which is not as easily lost or stolen. This
idea is also embraced in commercial products. Smart watches and other wearables can serve as
authentication tokens: Google offers the “Trusted Device” feature since Android version 5. If a
trusted device, e.g. a smart watch or wireless headphones, is connected to the phone via Bluetooth,
the phone turns off the primary authentication method, e.g. pattern unlock while the device is
connected. If the phone has been inactive for four hours or had been manually locked, the user
needs to re-authenticate by providing the primary credential. This can drastically reduce the
number of authentication events, given phones are unlocked between 27 and 86 times per day

<!--l. 469--><p class="noindent" >Other approaches leverage devices that the users carry with them anyhow as

A few popular websites have already started to adopt the system. Roalter et al. presented a system
that allowed users to access shared rooms in a university by authenticating with their smartphone
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRoalter2013SmartphoneProxy">270</a>]</span>. There is some evidence that users generally appreciate this kind of interaction <span class="cite">[<a

However, using the phone as proxy or second factor has the disadvantage that batteries might be
empty or the phone might be out of reach.

 id="x8-740002.5.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Federated Single Sign-On</span></span>
The idea behind single sign-on (SSO) is to allow the user to log into one service and other services
can use this login state without requiring any more explicit authentication actions. Thus, the user
must only remember one set of credentials <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013ProfilePassword">91</a>]</span>. With federated single sign-on, websites can
authenticate users by temporarily redirecting them to a trusted third party <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">34</a>]</span>. The third party
verifies the user’s identity. Afterwards it signs the authentication request and returns a text-based
token that the client needs to present in future interactions. A historically successful example is
Kerberos <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKohl1993Kerberos">197</a>]</span>. However, SSO approaches did not receive widespread acceptance for about
twenty years <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSun2010BillionKeys">322</a>]</span>. Currently, the OpenID protocol is a state of the art approach, where
user identities are verified in a decentralized approach <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRecordon2006OpenID">263</a>]</span>. Any web server can act as
identity provider, but it is most feasible if trustworthy parties enable OpenID. Currently,
Microsoft, Google and Oracle are among the biggest OpenID identity providers. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">OAuth </span>is a
related protocol, but is not designed as identity proof but to allow “relying parties” to
use resources on other websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">34</a>]</span>. For example, a web app can use OAuth to access
profile information on Facebook or publish Twitter messages on the user’s behalf. The
web app can create another dedicated user-account for its own purposes with the data it
receives from the OAuth interfaces, and automatically authenticate the user without
further notice. Perhaps this is the reason OAuth is often mistakenly seen as single sign-on
mechanism.
</p><!--l. 474--><p class="noindent" >Different analyses of the security and user experience of SSO mechanisms have yielded mixed
results. Ruoti et al. found that their participants ranked OpenID-like approaches as the preferred
way to authenticate <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRuoti2015AuthenticationMelee">272</a>]</span>. Sun et al., however, found that their survey respondents had often
erroneous mental models about how single sign-on works <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSun2011UsersRefuseSSO">323</a>]</span>. For instance, many people thought
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
that their passwords are shared with relying parties and also around 40% were concerned about
privacy in this study. Contrarily, Egelman pointed out that users who used Facebook Connect are
fairly cognizant of the data that is shared with relying parties <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013ProfilePassword">91</a>]</span>. Still, 15% of respondents
expressed privacy concerns and refrained from using such mechanisms. Bonneau et al. also criticize
big companies as identity providers by noting that “Facebook Connect (a version of OAuth),
incentivizes relying parties with user data, mandating a central role for Facebook as the
sole identity provider, which does little for privacy” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2015ImperfectAuthentication">35</a>]</span>. For users, leaving an identity
provider like Facebook also entails tedious account recovery on relying services like
Spotify<span class="footnote-mark"><a

In summary, SSO theoretically has the potential to drastically reduce the number passwords but it
brings out a new range of problems.

<!--l. 494--><p class="noindent" >Bonneau et al. argue that passwords are an imperfect technology that is difficult to replace, and so they answer
the question as to if we still need passwords with a differentiated “yes”: <span

<span class="cite">[<a

Thus, if passwords are not going away, multi-factor and multi-modal systems may turn out to be the
most promising solution. The challenge is to establish a minimally privacy-invasive solution that
embraces user-centered design to a higher degree than previous multi-factor/-modal approaches.
Academic research can, according to Bonneau et al., carry out those foundational experiments
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
whose costs would potentially have a detrimental effect on business successes. This might help in
pushing viable solutions forward when there is enough evidence for their business merit.
As Herley and van Oorshot point out: “[...] it is time to admit that passwords will be
with us for some time, and moreover, that in many instances they are the best-fit among
currently known solutions” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>. They propagate a more systematic approach to make
users’ lives easier instead of trying to find the single panacea that replaces passwords
entirely.
