<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Morris and Thompson were already concerned with user behavior regarding passwords in 1979
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">237</a>]</span>. They identified that users choose predictable passwords and that this can be leveraged for
attacks. So, they suggested enforcing a certain minimum password length (six characters). At the
time, the users were mostly professionals who received training to operate computers and could
thus also have been trained to pick less predictable passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMaguire2012YouOnlyLiveTwice">218</a>]</span>. But as computers were
introduced to a larger audience, more people were exposed to password authentication. Naturally,
this also induced a growing number of attacks, and it is increasingly difficult for users to defend
themselves against them (see. Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-480002.2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:attack_vectors --></a>). Nowadays, password policies are in place that
require not only a typical minimum of eight characters, but also mandate mixed-case
letters, digits and special symbols to start with. The HCI community noticed the users’
struggle in the 1990s and that we can – and should – design authentication systems with
usability in mind. Perhaps, one of the breaking points where a new school of thought
turned up in the literature was a paper by Adams and Sasse in 1999 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. The central and
novel theme in there was a shift from <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fixing </span>the user to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">acknowledging </span>user behavior
and designing for it. The paper managed to see over 1500 citations as of writing this
thesis.
</p><!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >This chapter looks at the literature that mostly came after this seminal work. It discusses the users’
problems, solutions, feelings, and opinions about using passwords. An essential goal is to give the
reader an empathetic perspective and provide background information to understand why it is
challenging to come up with viable solutions to make users’ lives less frustrating. To get there, we
first take a brief look at conducting user research with passwords. Hereafter we disseminate
common coping strategies and solutions.

 id="x53-770003.1"></a>Methodology: Running Password Studies</h3>
<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Before we report on insights about user behavior regarding passwords, we take a look into running
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
studies that focus on passwords. There are two central aspects that make collecting data particularly
challenging: acting ethically and maintaining high ecological validity of the data. In fact, these two
goals create an area of tension that demands a critical selection of methods. Komanduri et al. note
that “ideally, password studies would be conducted by collecting data on real passwords created by
real users of a deployed system” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>. But this would mean that researchers obtain
access to the user accounts that were under investigation. This is ethically questionable
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2012ItsNotStealing">92</a>]</span>. Maybe the researchers themselves are benevolent, but the data is precious and thus
could bring attackers to the scene. Since absolute security can barely be guaranteed, it
is best to avoid that users disclose their actual credentials during a user study to the
researchers.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x53-780003.1.1"></a>General Considerations for User Studies as Data Source</h4>
<!--l. 44--><p class="noindent" >If we cannot collect the users’ real password in its original form, what is the best way to measure,
e.g., cause and effect of novel interventions? There are several alternatives.
</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x53-790003.1.1"></a>Password Creation Tasks</h5>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >First, one asks participants to create a new password during the user study and stores these
passwords as part of the dataset. This approach resolves the issue of real-world password
disclosure, but introduces a number of problems. Studies should be ethical and thus transparent for
the most part. Hence, the study topic should be known to the participants. However, if participants
know that their passwords are studied, this could induce protective reactions to prevent giving hints
about their real passwords. In that case, the participants’ selection strategy does not
resemble their real-world behavior much and thus the ecological validity of the data is low
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">297</a>]</span>. Although it appears trivial, Fahl et al. suggest that in this scenario, asking the
participants whether they had acted like they normally would is a suitable indicator that helps
in weighting the data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">103</a>]</span>. It is also recommendable to give users a specific scenario
that allows them to immerse themselves in the task. Komanduri et al. argue that having
participants create passwords for fictional email accounts leads to more authentic behavior
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>. Some users, however, are less protective and provide one of their real passwords
regardless of the instruction (e.g. 26.5% in Fahl et al.’s study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">103</a>]</span>). The result is the
same as if the purpose of the study was concealed through an act of deception, which is
occasionally done in psychology studies (for a discussion see <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTai2012Deception">326</a>]</span>). For example, it can suffice
to tell participants a convincing <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">cover story</span>, e.g. that the purpose of the study is to do
a usability test of a social networking site, which also happens to involve an account
setup process (see <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFurnell2017GuidanceCompliance">129</a>]</span>). The data would be ecologically valid because the cover story
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
removes observer-expectancy and other biases, but users might still pick a password that is
not representative for their usual practices. Thus, for the researchers, it is extremely
difficult to tell “real” passwords and “new” passwords apart. Phishing or man in the middle
attacks are sometimes carried out to collect realistic passwords. Haque et al. conducted a
laboratory study where they told participants a cover story to create new accounts for
popular websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>. The websites, however, were re-created by the researchers and
stored the passwords on their own servers instead of performing actual registrations.
Egelman et al. used a proxy server to intercept traffic between the users and a real online
portal <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>. They also altered the websites to communicate their cover story that the
password had expired. This, however, creates an ethical conundrum, if the dataset is
published along with the paper. To allow others to verify that research is valid, reliable,
and generalizable, a published dataset is desirable, but in Egelman et al. or Haque et
al.’s studies this would put real user accounts at risk. Legal constraints like the EU’s
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) can prevent publishing data as well. Much
in the same vein, sharing research about successfully attacking passwords produces
a similar dilemma. For instance, one can put forward new cracking approaches (e.g.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMarechal2008AdvancesPWCracking">222</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XNarayanan2005FastDictionaryAttacks">239</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSchmidt2013Pitfalls">281</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2009PCFG">366</a>]</span>) that potentially affect common strength metrics (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-550002.3">2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:pw_strength_metrics --></a>) – but
attackers also benefit from this kind of knowledge. From an HCI perspective, one can
also unfold how users select passwords, which allows optimizing cracking efficiency
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">365</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">369</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >There are several methods to avoid acting unethically in studies where users are required
to create passwords. First of all, studies involving human subjects are assessed by an
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:IRB">Institutional Review Board (IRB)</a>, especially in the United States. This is done to ensure
an ethical study design that is unlikely to cause participants any harm. The <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:IRB">IRB</a> might
mandate a thorough debriefing of participants and meticulous documentation of the
experiment. In Europe, however, password studies are less commonly evaluated by an IRB
(or authors fail to mention the process in their papers – often there are remarks that
universities do not have such institutions like in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">103</a>]</span>). Secondly, one can refrain from
releasing the data set, even if user names are removed. In fact, almost all publications on
passwords collected during a user study omit publishing the corresponding data set. Only the
abstract analysis is published and this is a widely-accepted standard practice, despite the
questionable reliability. A rather novel approach that reduces the likelihood of made-up data
relies on the idea of publishing differentially private data sets. Here, algorithmically
generated noise, which is indistinguishable from the orignal data, is added to the data set to
preserve privacy of users. For password frequency lists, passwords could be mangled and
extended by generated passwords that resemble real ones. Adversaries lack information
whether the data is usable as signal or noise. This way, Blocki et al. managed to release a
private frequency list of passwords at Yahoo that Bonneau had already anonymously
analyzed <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">32</a>]</span>. Moreover, instead of collecting newly generated passwords in plain text, it is
possible to store a hashed version. For instance, Wash et al. had participants install a
browser extension that logged all form submits that included a password field <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>. To
study reused passwords, they hashed and sent them over a secure connection to their
servers. As long as a slow hash function and a strong salt are used, this approach is
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
uncritical. However, it merely allows observing if the hashes match on several sites.
Finally, as a last option to collect password data, researchers can log meta-data about
passwords. For instance, Von Zezschwitz et al. used a “meta password” that described the
participants’ actual passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">354</a>]</span>, but which was insufficient to reconstruct the original. This
description can include the number of characters, upper-/lowercase letters, digits, and
even proactive strength estimations. To collect the data, participants in von Zezschwitz
et al.’s study were provided with an offline password analysis tool. They entered their
password into that and copy-pasted the result of the analysis into the questionnaire form. If
one does not want to examine the full range of a password’s qualities, this approach is
absolutely feasible. Florêncio and Herley used a similar approach for the large-scale data
collection with around 500,000 participants to avoid running into privacy issues <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>]</span>. The
information transmitted to the logging server was pseudonymized and contained only meta
features. The only downside is that one cannot run further analyses on the passwords
after the data is collected, which might be necessary, e.g., if a new strength metric is
established.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x53-800003.1.1"></a>Retrospective Self Report</h5>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >If one wants to refrain from having users create a new password, one can study their past behavior
in different ways. In its simplest form, participants are simply asked to describe how they
create passwords. Stobert &#x0026; Biddle did this extensively to create the Password Life
Cycle model <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span> (see Section <a 
href="#x53-920003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:user-behavior --></a>). Ur et al. used interviews to find out what users
do to make their passwords stronger <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>. Das et al. found out through retrospective
interviews that social contacts have a strong impact on users’ security decisions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDas2014EffectSocialInfluenceSecuritySensitivity">68</a>]</span>. Most
commonly, however, typical online surveys feature a number of questions about personal
behavior and attitudes, e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1997MakingPWsSecureAndUsable">4</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XGaw2006PasswordManagement">133</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XKuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic">206</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XRiley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo">269</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2010EncounteringPasswordRequirements">298</a>]</span>. Questions about passwords are
easy to implement in a survey and respondents can always choose how much they want
to share. However, one has to stay aware that social desirability lowers the reliability
of the data: since news articles also do their part in shaming users for picking “bad”
passwords (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch14.html#x129-40400014">14<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:the_end --></a>), people may respond dishonestly about their password behavior.
Many people are uncomfortable admitting their password is as simple as 12345. Another
problem results from fading memories. Since most users have more than one password, it
might be difficult for them to recall the correct past behavior and their motivation for it.
Not only password studies suffer from this bias, but any study involving self report in
general.

<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >From user research in <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:USEC">Usable Security and Privacy (USEC)</a> of the past decades, Krol et al. derive a
set of general principles that researchers ought to consider when conducting experiments in security
and privacy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">205</a>]</span>. We can integrate password studies in there:
</p>
<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x53-820003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Primary Task</span></span>
Creating a password should not be the sole task in the study. Instead, participants should achieve a
primary task by authenticating with passwords, e.g. using a new system for a period of time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrostoff2000PassfacesEvaluation">41</a>]</span>.
The reasoning behind this principle is that security tasks are secondary tasks and this constraint
needs to be reflected in the experiment. However, re-focusing on a separate primary task is not
always possible, e.g. in surveys.
</p>
<!--l. 80--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x53-830003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Realistic Risk</span></span>
Users should be able to realistically estimate the risk for secure interactions. As mentioned above,
Komanduri et al. suggest carefully selecting real-world scenarios to achieve this <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>.
</p>
<!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x53-840003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">No Priming</span></span>
Whenever human behavior is studied, experiments should avoid influencing and biasing
participants with certain information. This avoids unnatural behavior.
</p>
<!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x53-850003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Double Blind Experiments</span></span>
If possible, the person carrying out the actual experiment should not be involved in the planning
and design of the study. Moreover, the participants should not know the details of the
study, either. On the experimenter side, unconscious bias and influence is mitigated, and
participants also do not know the “treatment” they receive (if any). Although this is a
desirable goal, there is little evidence that experiments typically follow this principle.
</p>

<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Instead of users creating new passwords, it is possible to make inferences about their behavior from
already existing data (for an overview see Table <span

The sources can often be traced back to illegal attacks, which makes the use of such data somewhat
questionable. However, it is a widely accepted method to contrast real-world practices and study
behavior. The data set that has probably been studied the most originates from a breach at
RockYou, a software development firm specialized at games for social networks. In 2009, an
attacker used an SQL injection to download around 32 Million plain-text passwords.
For instance, Veras et al. visualized semantic properties of passwords in this dataset
and highlight the high occurrence of dates in there <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVeras2012VisualizingSemanticsPasswords">349</a>]</span>. Wheeler relied on it to build
the zxcvbn password strength estimation system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">369</a>]</span>. More often, though, these data
sets serve as training data for password guessability benchmarks. Weir et al. took the
RockYou passwords to train their <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PCFG">PCFG</a> which served as a demonstration that entropy is
not a feasible strength metric for user-chosen passwords. Afterwards, it was integrated
into the training set of <a

href="dissli3.html#glo:PGS">PGS</a> is mostly used to gauge passwords collected through
a user study, e.g. under different policies <span class="cite">[<a

href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>. In conclusion,
publicly leaked data sets can often serve as ground truth for studies that aim to provide new
insights.

To gain the greatest control over experimental parameters, laboratory studies are the
go-to method. Both qualitative and quantitative studies are carried out in the lab,
with a slight surplus of qualitative studies. Among the most common methods, one
finds (semi-)structured interviews (<span class="cite">[<a

the lab (<span class="cite">[<a

task (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKraus2017Emoji">203</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XYang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity">382</a>]</span>). Long-term memorability studies in the lab are less common, because they
require participants to return to the lab, which may be too bothersome for many. However, this may
be the only option to evaluate alternative authentication schemes that are not yet mature enough to
be distributed.

experimenter has almost as much control as in a lab to answer certain research questions. Only the

costs, time consumption to carry them out, smaller sample sizes, and reduced ecological
validity.

Field studies for password research come in many flavors. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Online surveys </span>are among the most
common methods used in the field (<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGaw2005ReuseRecycle">132</a>, <a

href="dissli2.html#XViolettas2014PasswordsAvoidGreece">351</a>]</span>), due to their
lower cost and comparatively easy implementation. Other advantages like increased sample
size and more diversity in the data speak in favor of online surveys. Survey tools like
surveymonkey.com come in handy, but usually lack seamless integration of interactive
prototypes. If a prototype should be evaluated through a survey, however, one has to
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
either implement the entire survey structure or redirect participants from the survey
platform to the prototype and back. Surveys are also the weapon of choice if there is
an opportune moment that is worth studying. Mazurek et al. took the opportunity to
distribute online questionnaires after a new password policy was introduced at <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:CMU">CMU</a>
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>. Fahl et al. profited from a similar situation at Leibniz-University Hannover, and
Renaud et al. could even distribute surveys on the same topic across multiple years in
this way <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">267</a>]</span>. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a special, standardized survey
construct to measure the usability, respectively user experience, of password systems. Other
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:HCI">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</a> sub-fields more frequently use, for example, the NASA-TLX,
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PANAS">Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS)</a> or AttrakDiff constructs to establish
comparability with other studies. Notable exceptions were reported by Kraus et al., who
used AttrakDiff to evaluate emoji-based authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKraus2017Emoji">203</a>]</span>. The NASA-TLX was
used by Fraune et al., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFraune2013UserCreatedPictures">128</a>]</span>, Sherman et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSherman2014UserGeneratedGesturesAuth">302</a>]</span>, and Yang et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity">382</a>]</span>. Lately, the
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SeBIS">Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS)</a> gains more attention, because it serves as
a self-assessment that can help the interpretation of actions taken during a user study
<span class="cite">[<a

</p><!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >A special kind of online studies that has been extensively used and propagated by <a

researchers leverage <span

Survey respondents are recruited by paying each one a small amount of money for a valid response.
This way, increasing the sample size is straight-forward, if many users have already signed up on
the platform and are eligible for the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:HIT">Human Intelligence Task</a> (<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:HIT">HIT</a>). Workers (known as “turkers”)
form an increasingly diverse population <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRoss2010WhoAreTurkers">271</a>]</span>, which is another benefit. In password research, for
instance, Kelley et al.’s high-impact work on password guessability collected around 12000
passwords using <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKelley20012GuessAgain">191</a>]</span>. Ur et al. had participants rate the strength and memorability of a
given set of passwords, which allowed them to identify certain misconceptions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. Mazurek et
al. compared features of passwords created by turkers to real passwords of students and staff at
their university <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>. They take the large similarities of the two data sets as evidence
that passwords created during an mTurk study are a reliable and valid data source, so
there is no urgent need to analyze passwords of a deployed system. Shay wrote a PhD
thesis specifically about evaluating password policies with crowd-sourced data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015UsablePoliciesMTurk">293</a>]</span>. In
many cases, e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">295</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>, the primary task is to create a fictional account or
merely a password under certain constraints, which apparently violates Krol et al.’s
study principles <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">205</a>]</span>. It is especially interesting that most studies are announced as
some kind of password study, probably mandated by <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:IRB">IRBs</a> . But Mazurek et al.’s work
demonstrates that this limitation is bearable. Moreover, studying the long-term memorability of
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
passwords is facilitated, because participants can be invited to return through an internal,
anonymous messaging system. It is also possible to create more complex study designs with
mTurk, e.g. if multiple device types should be used by the turkers to create passwords
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span>. Despite the wide range of advantages, there are shortcomings of crowd-sourced
approaches as with any study method. First, turkers are incentivized to complete as many
HITs as possible on the platform to earn money. Thus, completing a survey by providing
quick answers without reading the questions could lead to unreliable data. Instructional
Manipulation Checks (IMCs) and attention check questions (ACQs) can mitigate this
problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOppenheimer2009InstructionalManipulationChecks">249</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XPeer2017BeyondTheTurk">253</a>]</span>. Turkers are only paid if the commissioner accepts the HIT as valid,
thus IMCs and attention checks are useful indicators here. Moreover, as of now, the
mTurk platform can only be used in certain countries, e.g. the USA or UK. European
alternatives exist, but are not yet par in terms of user base, response times, and feature set
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XPeer2017BeyondTheTurk">253</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" >Aside from surveys, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">diary studies </span>about passwords have proven feasible in the past.
Inglesant and Sasse found out through a diary study that employees struggle with frequent
password changes, which might not have become evident using other study means <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>.
Hayashi and Hong used this method to analyze password re-use across different computers,
services, and organizations <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs">159</a>]</span>. Since password authentication is a secondary task,
keeping a diary of authentication events helps participants provide reliable behavioral data.
However, it requires much effort to continuously stay aware of one’s actions and log them.
To avoid that participants forget logging and other self-reporting bias <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2017SelfReport">364</a>]</span>, it can be
worthwhile to ask them small questions in situ. This method, known as <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:ESM"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Experience</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Sampling Method (ESM)</span></a>, requests short responses either in predefined intervals or
when the system detects a relevant event. ESM has not seen much attention in password
studies on the web (Lyastani et al. provide one exception <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLyastani2017ImpactPWMPasswordStrength">217</a>]</span>), but mobile authentication
has been studied with this method <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>. Users carry their personal mobile with them
almost all the time, so there is a high chance of successfully receiving the experience
sample. ESM was also found useful for studies about security warnings in browsers
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAkhawe2013AliceInWarningland">8</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XFelt2016RethinkingConnectionSecurityIndicators">106</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps, ESM is underused for password studies because it can be substituted well with different,
less costly methods. It is possible to automatically detect relevant events and survey the
participants before and/or after the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">automatic data collection</span>. Florêncio and Herley
conducted one of the largest studies to date on password habits with this method <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>]</span>. Their
intention was to find out among other things A) how often people type passwords, B) how
many sites share a password C) how many distinct passwords a user has, and D) how the
strong the passwords are. Working at Microsoft, they were granted to utilize the Windows
Live Toolbar for Internet Explorer to collect in-the-wild data from up to 500,000 users
during three months of running the collection. They conceived the method of protected
password lists (PPL) to avoid intruding into people’s privacy – a kind of meta description of
passwords which is sent to the logging server instead of the original password. It was thus not
possible to trace the incoming data back to a specific user. However, there are a number of
limitations this method. The authors point out that the anonymity of the incoming data-stream
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
might have resulted in over-counting of entries. Also, it was not measured how long the
actual password entries takes. If users only used regular dictionary words without any
modification as their passwords, the key logging module of the toolbar would have recorded
a password reuse event (PRE) every time the user entered that word – also in regular
online communication. Nevertheless, the fact that users are typically focused on their
primary tasks, background logging helps to collect unbiased data with high ecological
validity.
</p><!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >A final option to study passwords in the field is to collect and analyze them in an already
deployed system (<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">in-situ evaluation</span>), which would be the ideal data source, according to
Komanduri et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>. Brostoff and Sasse utilized a coursework system to evaluate
Passfaces as alternative to passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrostoff2000PassfacesEvaluation">41</a>]</span>. Similarly, Renaud et al. used a coursework tool to
evaluate the effectiveness of different password nudges <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">267</a>]</span>. Mazurek et al. gained
access to passwords of their University’s <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SSO">Single-Sign On (SSO)</a> and were able to break
down differences in password selection behavior by departments. As one of the few
exceptions from the industry, Bonneau analyzed a private password data set at Yahoo <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">32</a>]</span> and
Amazon <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">37</a>]</span>. The data is highly ecologically valid and diverse if it originates from a real
product or service. However, if interventions are implemented as part of a password
experiment, this might have negative consequences for both the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SP">service provider</a> and the users.
For instance, in an A/B setting one intervention to influence password selection might
in fact lead to weaker passwords and put users at risk. Each user is a critical potential
source of revenue for <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SP">service providers</a>, so tampering with the sign-up procedure might
lead to higher bounce rates and consequently financial damage. High stakes like this
make it difficult for researchers to convince stakeholders to cooperate on a study. In
conclusion, it is unsurprising to see only rare instances of password studies carried out
with deployed systems in public environments, although the insights gained might be
invaluable.

<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Using one of the study methods above is the first step to get closer to answering the research
methods. However, to get the full picture of the studied phenomenon, a <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">triangulated </span>approach
appears to be the only option. For example, Wash et al. combined a survey with log analyses to
study password reuse and self-report issues <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>. A multi-tiered approach like in Von Zezschwitz
et al.’s study helps to identify themes first (formative stage) and quantify them later (summative
stage) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2014HoneyIShrunkTheKeys">355</a>]</span>. Similarly, Huh et al. were able to refine their concept of system-initiated
user-replaceable passwords through triangulation <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuha2015UserReplaceablePasswords">170</a>]</span>. Adams and Sasse conducted qualitative
interviews to follow up web survey results <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. If constraints allow for only one method, it is
recommendable to consider how to collect both quantitative and qualitative data points. For
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
instance, in online surveys that evaluate a novel password intervention, it is always feasible to
collect quantitative metrics (e.g. usability and password strength) and qualitative data
(reasoning, explanations, feedback) to put study results into context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. Those eager to find
additional starting points for <a

drawn on to fulfill those principles, which we try to achieve in Part <a

<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >Passwords are the cornerstone of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">knowledge-based </span>authentication. And although “knowledge” can
be stored inside and retrieved from computers, it is still a human capability to learn things and
hereafter “know” them. So, humans are a large factor in the equation of knowledge-based
authentication. Their actions and behavior to gain knowledge on passwords deserve to be studied in
detail.
</p><!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >Some cybersecurity researchers started blaming system failures and vulnerabilities on users. For
instance, Feldmeier et al. stated in 1990: “The main weakness in any password system is that users
often choose easily guessable passwords: English words, names, trivial extensions to English
words, etc., because they are easy to remember” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFeldmeier1990UnixPasswordSecurity">104</a>]</span>. It quickly became a dictum that users
were the “weakest link” in the figurative authentication chain <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2001WeakestLink">276</a>]</span>. However, since the
late 1990s, <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:HCI">HCI</a> advocates that systems take into account user capabilities and not the
other way around <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>]</span>. Adams and Sasse postulated in 1999 that <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SP">service providers</a>
acknowledge that “users are not the enemy”, which is one of the most influential position
papers on the topic <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. In that paper, they provide four central challenges in password
authentication that users face: 1) Users have to deal with multiple passwords, 2) users do not
intuitively create strong passwords 3) password procedures and work practices might
conflict and 4) users develop a sub-par understanding of organizational security issues.
Those challenges are often too hard to come by in everyday password authentication
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDourish2004UserStrategiesEveryday">87</a>]</span>. As a consequence, users develop coping strategies to reduce their task load. This
early framework has since been fed with numerous research studies and is still valid
today.
</p><!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >Stobert and Biddle formalized user challenges and behavior in the “Password Life Cycle” (see
Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>), which they arrived at through qualitative interviews and coding the participants’
responses <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. It starts out with the challenge to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">choose a password</span>. Coping strategies at this
point revolve around reducing effort, e.g. to memorize the password. Including personal or
personally meaningful information comes natural to users. Others include pointers to the time they
created it, or word-associations about the website-content. Mnemonics are found with some users,
especially those aiming to secure their account. In essence, however, users often memorize their
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">coping strategy</span>, to recall their password. Consistent strategies reduce the effort effectively. Even if
complex policies mandate a change to the first-choice password, users have a go-to strategy to deal
with this situation, e.g. by appending a preferred symbol. When people create passwords, the
most common action is to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">reuse an old password</span>. This is not always possible, so users
need to maintain and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">commit to </span>a number of passwords. Hayashi et al. observed in a
diary study that users categorize accounts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs">159</a>]</span> in different ways. There is also a mix of
different password retrieval methods at the commitment stage. A survey in 2017 from
Pew Research Center with N=926 participants found that the vast majority commits
to their passwords by memorizing them in their heads (preferred strategy for 65% of
the respondents) or by noting down the password (49% do this, and it is the preferred
strategy for 18%) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span>. Some respondents also either saved passwords in their browser
(18%) or used a dedicated password manager (12%), but this appears to be a negligible
go-to strategy (5% of the respondents). Once the user has committed to a password,
they <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">live with it</span>, even if it produces difficulties in certain situations. For instance, the
question “when is it time to change the password?” falls into that stage of the cycle. Finally,
if passwords are not actively used on a regular basis, or were recently changed, it is
very foreseeable that users <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">forget their passwords</span>. The password reset mechanism
helps users cope with this situation. The two options at this point are either to create a
completely new password (which increases the likelihood of forgetting it), or to reuse
one (which potentially reduces the number of unique passwords). Then the cycle starts
over. In the following we shed light on the actions and consequences at the different
stages.

<!--l. 193--><p class="noindent" >Why do users select weak passwords? First of all, selecting a strong password is hard for
most people. Picking up the definition of a strong password (“something that is easy to
remember, but difficult to guess” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBishop1995ProactivePasswordChecking">25</a>]</span>), users do not struggle with the first part of the
sentence, but the latter. Users do not intuitively know what makes a password <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">difficult to</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">guess </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XJakobsson2013BenefitsUnderstandingPWs">177</a>]</span>, and not even security researchers have reached ultimate consensus on that
matter.
</p><!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >Let us look at the first part: something that is easy to remember. Numerous studies have
looked at what people do to make their passwords easy to remember. For instance,
personal information is very memorable (“<span 
class="ectt-1200">TobiasSeitz</span>”), as is that of close ones
(“<span 
class="ectt-1200">LenaSeitz</span>”) and pets (“<span 
class="ectt-1200">Fonsi&#x0026;Alois</span>”) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBrown2004GeneratingPWs">42</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XLi2017PersonalInformation">209</a>]</span>. Veras et al. found that dates
are very commonly found in passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVeras2012VisualizingSemanticsPasswords">349</a>]</span>. Looking at the top 25 most-used
passwords<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss56.html#fn3x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x53-93001f3"></a>,
a list published after each public data leak, we can easily spot more patterns. One group consists of
“keyboard patterns” (qwerty, qazwsx) and “number sequences” (12345, 123456, 1234567489,
1234567, 123123). The remainder fall into the “likings” (football, monkey, iloveyou, starwars,
dragon) and “password thematic” (Password, letmein, admin, welcome, login, passw0rd, master,
hello, trustno1) categories. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> shows additional selection techniques. All of these
passwords are particularly easy to remember, which was quantified by Chiasson et al.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2009InterferencesGraphical">52</a>]</span>, but extremely predictable. However, they are often still allowed at many websites
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSeitz2017PoliciesReuse">288</a>]</span>. Interestingly, such password lists differ marginally across countries <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XViolettas2014PasswordsAvoidGreece">351</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWang2015ChinesePWs">359</a>]</span>.
Consequently, users’ <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">desire to create memorable passwords </span>naturally leads to more obvious
selections.

</div><hr class="endfigure" />
<!--l. 209--><p class="noindent" >Another reason for the prevalence of weak passwords lies in incorrect <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mental models</span>. Mental
models are descriptions of how humans make sense of functions and system states <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">352</a>]</span>. Some
users who aim to create stronger passwords still fail because their strategies to accomplish the task
are predictable. Gaw et al. found that mangling is predictable <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGaw2005ReuseRecycle">132</a>]</span>. Ur et al. pointed out that users
understand a great deal of password security, but their modification behavior of existing passwords
is sub-par <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>. Moreover, they provide evidence that users succeed to identify strong passwords,
but certain characteristics are misleading <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. For instance, including digits yielded significantly
higher subjective strength ratings, but does not always effectively improve strength. What is more is
that participants in their study showed a skewed understanding of password attacks.
For instance, 34% of respondents thought that a strong password needs to withstand at
least 50 guesses by an attacker. Therefore, trying to fend off a dictionary attack might
be futile if users do not know that attackers attempt to crack the password trillions of
times. Ur et al. conclude that feedback should thus inform users about attack scenarios
which helps them assess the risk more realistically. Although it is sometimes argued
that passphrases, i.e. a combination of multiple dictionary words, are often as secure as
passwords from a richer character set <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">297</a>]</span>, users fail to create strong passphrases, too.
Bonneau studied the linguistic properties of passphrases at Amazon and noted that an
attacker could easily model user behavior to effectively crack passphrases <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">37</a>]</span>. So, in
other words, the mental model “passphrase = secure” is also wrong and problematic.
Finally, mental models also play a role for risk assessment in organizations. In many
cases, employees underestimate the security threat that companies face day to day, which
leads to insecure password practices <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">368</a>]</span>. To summarize this point, users fail to
create strong passwords, because in many cases <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">erroneous mental models </span>stand in the
way.
</p><!--l. 214--><p class="noindent" >What reports and news articles on password security often call “laziness” and “stupidity” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">352</a>]</span>
may in fact be the rational rejection of password security. Riley pointed out that users are well
aware of “better” behavior, but they often ignore it by choice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRiley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo">269</a>]</span>. Florêncio et al. argue that this
behavior is absolutely rational, because some accounts do not require strong protection and it
would be impossible for users to follow all security advice given by experts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">116</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XReeder2017SimpleSteps">264</a>]</span>. A case
example of an account that may be valuable for some, but not for others is LinkedIn.
The social-media platform which is focused on business connections suffered a severe
data breach in 2012, but only became aware of a much larger leakage in 2016. Many
hashed passwords had leaked and thus the affected users were prompted to reset their
passwords. Huh et al. investigated the reasons (not) to reset the password and in many
instances, people said that they do not use the service very often, did not want to, or were not
really concerned about the risks <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuh2017TooBusy">169</a>]</span>. Ur et al.’s results also indicate that users do know
in theory what makes a strong password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. A survey commissioned by LastPass
reported that one group of users often do not care about their accounts if they are not
meaningful to them <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked">208</a>]</span>, while the other group is overly careful, but there does not
appear to be a “just fine” area of behavior. The first group may believe that stronger
passwords do not accomplish protection anyhow <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007DoStrongWebPasswords">114</a>]</span>. Herley and Pieters argue that it is also
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
difficult to objectively falsify claims about security precautions, which would help to
debunk unjustified security advice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. So, in essence, users choose weak passwords
because they think <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">the account is unimportant </span>and therefore it is fine to ignore security
advice.
</p><!--l. 218--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, the literature lists a few other reasons that lead to weak passwords. Groß et al. looked at the
association between cognitive depletion and selection behavior <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGross2016EffectCognitiveEffort">143</a>]</span>. They reach the conclusion
that if cognitively challenging tasks precede password selection, the resulting passwords tend to get
weaker. Von Zezschwitz et al. point out that a user’s first passwords are created probably in teenage
years when security precautions might be much less evident to people <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">354</a>]</span>. For important
accounts, these early passwords are modified, but still persist for many years after they were first
committed to. Mobile phones are another factor that steadily gains more importance. Under
lab conditions, Yang et al. found that participants included more lowercase letters in
passwords, if they created them on a smartphone <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity">382</a>]</span>. Von Zezschwitz et al. corroborate the
findings and argue that passwords created on smartphones are much less diverse than their
desktop-counterparts, because they are shorter and contain mostly lowercase letters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2014HoneyIShrunkTheKeys">355</a>]</span>.
Two years later, Melicher et al. studied the interoperability of passwords on different
platforms <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span>. Interestingly, the passwords created on mobiles were only marginally
weaker than those created on a desktop, but had more potential to lead to user frustration,
especially if requirements were too bothersome. The individual keyboard on a mobile
influences frustration levels, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword">153</a>]</span>. In summary, contextual factors like cognitive
depletion and the device used during password creation have a notable impact on password
strength.
</p><!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" >We thus identify four main themes from related work that cause weak passwords: 1) Weak
passwords are more memorable. 2) Hard-to-change mental models prevent the creation of stronger
passwords. 3) In many situations, users rationally reject the effort to create a strong password. 4)
Contextual factors notably influence selection strategies. In the following, we dissect another
coping strategy, which is potentially even riskier than selecting weak passwords: password
reuse.
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x53-940003.2.2"></a>Password Reuse</h4>
<!--l. 230--><p class="noindent" >The primary reason for password reuse is the mere fact that users create new accounts on a regular
basis, and it is logical to make sure to be able to log in later by choosing a secret they already know.
“Password overload” essentially frames the problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYang2016MnemonicSentenceBased">381</a>]</span>. “Memory interference” postulates reuse
as a coping strategy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2009InterferencesGraphical">52</a>]</span>. In 2007, Florêncio and Herley conducted a large-scale study that
empirically showed the challenges and coping strategies regarding this overload <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>]</span>: Users of
the Windows Live Toolbar had 6.5 distinct passwords, each of which was used for 3.9 different
websites. During the data collection period, users logged into 25 accounts on a regular
basis, and typed around 8 passwords per day. Although keeping track of the multitude of
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
username-password combinations is a tough challenge, most users still rely on their memory
instead of other tools <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span>. Users realize the challenge is hard, but Woods et al. argue that
users underestimate their capabilities when it comes to memorizing passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWoods2018TooManyPasswords">377</a>]</span>.
Consequently, many people do not try to create a richer portfolio of passwords than the numbers
from the 2007 study showed. More recent numbers show that between 39% <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span> and
76% <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCSID2012PasswordHabits">64</a>]</span> of users rely on reuse as coping strategy. Since social desirability bias could
lead to dishonest survey responses, the “dark figure” might even be higher, because, as
Inglesant and Sasse put it, “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Users see ‘good’ passwords (that are memorable and conform to</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">the policy) as a ‘resource’, which they continue to use for new applications even if the</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">original use is no longer allowed.</span>” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>. What is more is that the user name is part of the
authentication process, and users pick different aliases, pseudonyms, emails for different accounts
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs">159</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 232--><p class="noindent" >All this is consequential for the overall online security of an individual. The more a user relies
on reuse passwords, the more severe phishing attacks and data breaches become. The
metaphorical “Domino Effect” describes the situation after a breach: When an attacker obtains a
password from one user’s account, all the other accounts might fall with it <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XIves2004DominoEffectReuse">173</a>]</span>. It is
enough to know even only one low-value password to crack a large part of high-value
passwords via predictable mangling rules <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDas2014TangledWeb">67</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>. Still, password reuse is difficult
to mitigate, so Ives argues to look into understanding the specific approaches better
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XIves2004DominoEffectReuse">173</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 236--><p class="noindent" >One such approach is to categorize passwords by different criteria. Here, we can borrow the
“Mental Accounting” theory from Behavioral Economics to describe users’ risk assessments
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStockinger2015TowardsBE">320</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XThaler2004">330</a>]</span>. Users put their passwords into mental accounts that help them recall them
later. Wash et al. argues that frequently entered credentials are reused more likely than
seldom used ones <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>. However, interviewees in Stobert and Biddle’s study reported the
opposite behavior <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. Florêncio and Herley noticed that strong passwords (in terms of
entropy) are less frequently reused than weak passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">111</a>]</span>. Here again, Wash et
al. observed the opposite: participants in their study prioritized stronger passwords as
reuse candidates <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>. If the latter is true, then this is another indicator for problematic
mental models regarding risk assessment: users try to follow security advice and prefer
strength over uniqueness which is typically also advised. Nonetheless, strategies (or at least
results) appear to fluctuate throughout the years. Many users cluster their secrets regarding
the usage purpose <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>, e.g. banking, social media, communication, shopping, etc.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XNotoatmodjo2007ExploringWeakestLink">245</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PWMThatDoesntRemember">315</a>]</span>. Bailey et al. argue that users do not really respect the usage purpose, but the
value, importance, and meaningfulness of the account <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBailey2014StatisticsReuse">17</a>]</span>. In that sense, users do not
appear to care if the password ought to protect financial information if the website does
not mean much to them. Radke et al. found users in their diary study tended to create
unique passwords for important accounts, and reuse passwords for less important ones
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRadke2013WhoDecides">260</a>]</span>. Still, probably all users have a “go-to password” that is tried first for an account
whose value is uncertain in the beginning <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. If password requirements disallow the
preferred choice, the go-to password might not work anymore. Typically, users either pick
another password from their portfolio in that situation, or they mangle their first choice
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
until all requirements are met. As we show in Chapter <a 
href="dissch6.html#x83-1610006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:policies_reuse --></a>, neither strategy is necessary if
the go-to-password already shows certain features. But in case the policy mandates a
change, Gaw and Felten have laid out that user-chosen mangling strategies are predictable,
too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XGaw2006PasswordManagement">133</a>]</span>. Besides, policies might not be the only reason for password modifications.
Over time, users sometimes are exposed to new security advice or other realizations that
their previous password strategy is generally considered weak <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">354</a>]</span>. Taking the current
(already memorized) credentials, and applying the recommendations to them is an obvious
choice.
</p><!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >Florêncio et al. described reuse, categorization, memorable passwords, and mangling as “finite
effort” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">116</a>]</span>. They meticulously lay out that these strategies are not only common, but inevitable
and necessary. Even experts in cybersecurity show similar patterns <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLoutfi2015PasswordsOtherSideOfTheFence">216</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2015ExpertPassword">317</a>]</span>. The major
difference between mainstream users and experts is that the latter are more articulate and
considerate about their coping strategies.
</p><!--l. 252--><p class="noindent" >In conclusion, we can hang on to the idea that password reuse is a necessary coping strategy.
Zhang-Kennedy et al. motivate that it is not even “bad” or “risky” per se <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">389</a>]</span>. The
challenge is to do it “right”. However, motivating users to alter this particular aspect is
comparable to motivating a smoker to quit their guilty pleasure: Abandoning reuse does not
show a visible immediate pay-off (nor does quitting smoking). In many cases, it does
not cause harm, even though 16% of US-Americans have experiences someone else
taking over their accounts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span> (a similar percentage of active smokers develop lung

<!--l. 257--><p class="noindent" >To avoid memory interference, many users resort to writing down their passwords. In its simplest
form, a sheet of paper that holds user name and password suffices. Roughly half the users
reportedly do this <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span>. Many users also use a dedicated note-book that keeps their passwords
in one place <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKothari2017PasswordLogbooks">202</a>]</span>. Interestingly, some manufacturers offer “password-logbooks” to
help users organize their credentials. Kothari et al. collected customer reviews about the
ten most reviewed logbooks and analyzed their content to derive a mental model of
password security <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKothari2017PasswordLogbooks">202</a>]</span>. They were surprised how many people apparently use one of
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
those logbooks and what their motivations are. For instance, customers often loved the
inconspicuousness of the books and gave them away as presents. Age-related memorability
challenges were also a central theme. Many people acknowledged the security risks but were
unsure if a piece of software would be more secure than the book. Password logbooks
can become a single point-of-failure. Digital files on the computer are often almost as
accessible to local attackers (friends / spouses). In the workplace, writing passwords down on
sticky notes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XConklin2004PWAuthenticationSystemPerspective">59</a>]</span> leaves the credentials wide open to anyone passing by and enforcing
different behavior is difficult. Nevertheless, Herley and Van Oorschot generally advocate
writing down as coping strategy, as long as the notes are stored in a fairly secure location

</p><!--l. 260--><p class="noindent" >Using a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">password manager</a> (<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>) is a more sophisticated way of “externalizing” passwords. In
essence, a password manager is a digital representation of the “logbooks” described above, but
comes with many helpful extra features, like easy access, encryption with a master password etc. A
plethora of services and tools exist in different flavors (e.g. built into browsers, third party
programs, browser extensions, free vs. premium, cloud-based vs. local). Notable representatives
include LastPass (freemium/subscription), 1Password (premium/subscription), KeePassX (free,
one-off payment for apps), and Dashlane (freemium/subscription). Arias-Cabarcos et al. evaluated
popular PWMs and suggest that Dashlane provides the the most feasible usability/security trade-off
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAriasCabarcos2016ComparingPWM">12</a>]</span>. However, surveys have often revealed the low adoption rate of password managers <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span>,
mostly because users feel secure enough with their current management habits, or due to financial
hurdles and distrust <span class="cite">[<a

</p><!--l. 263--><p class="noindent" >Lyastani et al. recently investigated the impact of using a PWM on password strength and reuse
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLyastani2017ImpactPWMPasswordStrength">217</a>]</span>. Those <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWMs</a> which included a generator had a positive effect on overall password strength
and diversity in the large sample studied in-situ. But existing user strategies thwarted a boost in
security, e.g. if a built-in <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a> is solely used to store reused passwords. Users often
benefit from automatically filled login-forms and do not have to type their passwords
anymore, which is a huge usability plus. Autofill moreover mitigates most phishing attacks,
because the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a> verifies the domain before filling the password field. As with analog
notepads, PWMs are a single point of failure, especially in case the master password is
weak. This is one of the few instances in which a strong password is recommended
without restrictions. Password managers constitute a honey pot for attackers, who, e.g.,
exploit security vulnerabilities of the software to gain access to user passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">34</a>]</span>. The
situation is aggravated if passwords are synced to the manufacturer’s cloud storage,
although this is recommended by Yee to enable seamless availability <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYee2006Passpet">384</a>]</span>. To summarize,
password managers are a feasible solution for many users, but adoption rates are still fairly
low.

create a new password. In the past, password resets had been responsible for a large portion of
helpdesk calls <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2001WeakestLink">276</a>]</span>, but self-service procedures have successfully mitigated the issue. Users tend
to reuse passwords or mangle an old password when they forget and reset their credentials <span class="cite">[<a

some cases, however, password reset links are replaced by personal knowledge questions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2015SecretsLies">33</a>]</span>.
These often present a great risk to user accounts because of the statistical probability
involved (e.g. “what was the make of your first car” has a predictable distribution), or
the information is discoverable on social networks (e.g. “what is your city of birth”).
Consequently, a strong primary password can be dominated by a weak fallback question and
voids user efforts to secure their account. Perhaps the only strategy to maximize security
within this scheme is to provide bogus answers to secret questions to fend-off statistical
attacks<span class="footnote-mark"><a

with one’s own reuse strategy and pick strong passwords in a select number of cases,

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x53-1000003.3.1"></a>Password Composition Policies</h4>
<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >In terms of guiding users, combating weak passwords has received the most attention from research
and practice. The idea of enforcing certain password requriments dates back to the 1970s, i.e. the
early days of cybersecurity. Morris and Thompson acknowledged password authentication is
inherently flawed in terms of usability. They suggested to make users either choose longer
passwords, or systematically assign passwords to them to <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">237</a>]</span>. At the time, guessing attacks were
not as powerful as they are today and it was obvious to shift responsibility to users <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFeldmeier1990UnixPasswordSecurity">104</a>]</span>. When the
Electronic Authentication guideline was published by <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a>, password composition policies
became the de-facto standard in attempting to make users select stronger passwords.
The NIST guideline suggested passwords be at least eight characters long, include at
least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, and one special symbol <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBurr2004NISTEntropy">47</a>]</span>.
Moreover, passwords may not be taken from a dictionary with common words and not be
permutations of the username. By looking at entropy estimates, it was argued that the
resulting passwords would achieve at least 30 bits of entropy. Interestingly, this was
not the only specification for policies. The guideline specifically says that passwords
could also be graded with some other metric and be rejected based on their estimated
entropy. At the time, there was not much evidence that user-selected passwords created
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
under the NIST-policy were in fact strong, which set off a number of research studies,
and made password composition policies one of the most studied topics in password
security.
</p><!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" >Proctor et al. found in 2002 that certain “proactive password restrictions” lead to stronger
passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XProctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions">258</a>]</span>. In two laboratory experiments, they had participants create a new password for
a university account. The policies differed in the required minimum length (five and
eight) and complexity requirements like upper-/lowercase letters and digits. Requiring
more complexity was comparable to increasing the minimum required length in terms
of successfully cracked passwords. Interestingly, they concluded “Perhaps the most
important message of this study is that restrictions on user-generated passwords may not
accomplish their intended goals.” Proctor et al.’s early hypothesis that strict policies are more
or less ineffective is particularly surprising because in the fifteen years that followed,
many research papers were written about such restrictions and many of them ultimately
came to similar conclusions. In the following, some of the most influential works are
summarized.
</p><!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" >Inglesant and Sasse report on a diary study of password policies in corporate contexts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>. They
reached the disillusioning conclusion that password policies reduce employees’ productivity. Once
the participants found a password that fulfilled the company’s policy, they used it as a resource to
turn to when creating additional accounts. Similarly, Komanduri et al. found that users
barely go beyond the minimum requirements of policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">200</a>]</span>, but some policies yield
better results than others. Weir et al. categorize policies into “explicit” and “implicit”
policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">365</a>]</span>. Explicit policies have predefined rules about the password structure like
the NIST guideline, which is explicitly based on <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:LUDS">lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols
(LUDS)</a> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">369</a>]</span>. On the other hand, implicit policies focus on strength estimation and
are somewhat more volatile and intransparent to the users. For instance, if the policy
uses a blacklist of forbidden words, the list is usually not displayed to users up front.
The blacklist only becomes visible after the first attempt is made. Moreover, Weir et al.
used subsets of the RockYou data set that fulfilled the NIST policy. Here, they provided
early pointers that many of the seemingly complex passwords can be easily cracked,
too.
</p><!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" >Thus, the logical next step was to find replacements for the NIST policy with better usability and
security. First attempts to find it were of theoretical nature. Blocki et al. modeled an “optimal”
policy as algorithmically solvable challenge <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBlocki2013OptimizingPasswordPolicies">28</a>]</span>, which had been proposed by Shay <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2009PolicySimulation">294</a>]</span>.
However, while theoretically sound, empirical evidence was necessary to quantify the effects on
user behavior.

href="dissli2.html#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">295</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>:
Basic policies that only mandate a certain length (e.g. basic12), character-class centric policies that
require between 2 and 4 different character classes and a given length (e.g. 3class12), policies
requiring phrase-like syntax and a given length (e.g. 2word16), and complex policies that have
more than 4 specific requirements (comp8). Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> illustrates the specific differences as
found in the taxonomy. In multiple studies they compared the guessability of passwords
under different variants. They found that a 3class16 policy produced the least guessable
passwords, while basic12 yielded the highest cracking success rates. For a limited attacker,
who can make up to <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">6</span> guesses, basic16 and basic20 performed poorly, but they fared
well at the cut-off threshold of <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">14</span>. The NIST-policy (comp8) performed well up to
<span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">6</span> guesses, but almost as many passwords had been cracked after <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">14</span> guesses as for
the basic12 policy. This refutes the postulation that character diversity automatically
leads to stronger passwords when users select them. Shay et al. point out that 28% of
participants in the comp8 condition only fulfilled the criteria by adding an exclamation mark
“!” at the end, which was later corroborated by Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>. So, as hypothesized,
policies significantly influence the strength of user-generated passwords. In terms of
usability, there are signficant differences, too. Shay et al. examined typical usability
metrics and participants’ subjective assessments. Basic12 passwords were the easiest to
create, fastest to type and easiest to remember. Interestingly, the 3class12 policy was
comparable in all dimensions. All in all, basic16, 3class12, and 2word16 seem like the
“winners” in terms of security and usability, but 2word16 passwords have high beta
guess rates <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>. To combat this, Shay et al. suggest blacklisting specific sub-strings

arising from data breaches. If password leaks go unnoticed, at least the credentials expire at
regular points. For users, an expiration policy drastically increases password overload and
memory interference, for which the typical coping strategies (see Section <a 
href="#x53-920003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:user-behavior --></a>) prevail: an
expired “password1” quickly is reset to “password2” and so forth <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XZhang2010PasswordExpiration">388</a>]</span>. Thus, it has been
argued that expiration is ineffective and causes users too much effort without graspable
security benefits. Chiasson et al. set out to quantify the benefits of expiration and their
mathematical model strongly indicated that the benefits are “marginal at best” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XChiasson2015QuantifyingExpiration">53</a>]</span>. If
expiration is not enforced, security experts often advise users to manually change their

<span class="cite">[<a

universities <span class="cite">[<a

loosest policies. The researchers argue that decisions in these companies are not only
influenced by security officers (who evangelize password strength and expiration) but also
by user experience experts (who point out the usability issues). In public institutions,
security advisors outnumber human-factors experts, which is why policies represent
an “overshoot” of security there, imposing considerable nuisance at marginal security
benefits.
</p><!--l. 322--><p class="noindent" >To summarize, policies have the power to influence password behavior. However, this influence
arises from coercion and thus risks reduced usability. Users often cope by picking the easiest

We summarized common advice and the characteristics of “bad passwords” in Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-600002.4">2.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:whats_a_bad_pw --></a>. The
original <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a> guideline also read more like a “how to” than a dictum for policies, although it was
translated into policies after all. Sasse et al. expressed doubts about the effectiveness of user
education, because it “will only work if users are motivated” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2001WeakestLink">276</a>]</span>. We know by now that
security is a secondary goal, and thus it is unlikely that people are motivated to educate
themselves about it. Therefore, we have to focus on the restriction “<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">if </span>users are motivated” and
present advice effectively in this opportune moment. Security can become the primary
task, or on-par with the primary task. For instance, the moment users adopt a password
manager and have to set-up their master password, they not only want to simplify password
management, but also ensure that their central hub is safeguarded against attacks. Some
web-accounts are of great value and users are potentially open to receive support to secure
those.
</p><!--l. 335--><p class="noindent" >We can identify four central problems with password advice. 1) There is no consensus about
adequate password strength, because it always depends on the attack model. Thus, any
guideline should differentiate between threat models and brief the users about them.
However, this is rarely done in practice and most advice is opinionated <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. Besides,
password advice becomes outdated if new threat models prevail. 2) Reading a guide does not
necessarily translate into action. Herley says users are rational in rejecting advice if it
entails too much effort <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2009SoLongThanksExternalities">162</a>]</span>. Forget et al. empirically showed that advice can lead to
insecure behavior, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007HelpingUsers">123</a>]</span>. 3) Users misread password advice. Ur et al. argue that users
misconstrue a statement like “adding digits, upper-case letters, lower-case letters and
symbols add to the strength of the passwords” to “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">all </span>passwords with digits, upper and
lower case letters, and symbols are strong” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>]</span>. Heterogeneous composition policies,
and feedback can influence mental models, too. Forget et al. argue that one needs to
understand users’ mental models of authentication first, before they can be effectively
instructed <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007HelpingUsers">123</a>]</span>. 4) Lastly, if password advice achieves to change user behavior on a larger
scale, password guessing attacks will be modeled around the recommendations, too
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>. Thus, in the long run, advice needs to be revised because attacks become too
efficient.
</p><!--l. 348--><p class="noindent" >To conclude, one needs to stay realistic about what can be achieved with password advice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFlorencio2016CommACM">117</a>]</span>.
Zhang-Kennedy et al. provide one such realistic view on advice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">389</a>]</span>. They revised the “character
diversity” recommendation and suggest not using common passwords, predictable substitutions, or
dictionary words. However, we still face the problem of communicating to users what “common”
passwords and “predictable substitutions” are. Zhang-Kennedy et al. propose users should come up
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
with original mnemonics, which is a special kind of advice discussed in the following
section.

<!--l. 354--><p class="noindent" >Many researchers have proposed techniques and algorithms to help users create memorable and
strong passwords. We have already discussed Haskett’s PassAlgorithms <span class="cite">[<a

remembered how to respond to a challenge rather than a static password. Let us take a look at more
such approaches.

 id="x53-1030003.3.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Mnemonics and Training</span></span>
Barton and Barton were likely the first to propose mangling strategies in this context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBarton1984Mangling">18</a>]</span>. For
instance, they suggested to use sentence-based mnemonics and mentally connect passwords to
different cities. For instance, a sentence like “I love Paris in the Springtime” would translate into
“IlPitS”. This work was seminal and some of its techniques persist in password recommendations
today. Yan et al. empirically showed that there are benefits in terms of memorability and security of
the resulting passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYan2004PasswordMemorabilitySecurity">380</a>]</span>. However, Forget et al. observed that telling participants to generate
phrase-based passwords can be misinterpreted and more guidance is necessary to achieve benefits
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007HelpingUsers">123</a>]</span>. Maqbali <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMaqbali2016PasswordGenerators">220</a>]</span> and McEvoy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMcevoy2016ContextualizingMnemonicPhrase">230</a>]</span> recommend using contextual or site-specific cues on
websites as mnemonics.
</p><!--l. 359--><p class="noindent" >Memorization by repetitive training has also been suggested. Bonneau and Schechter put forward a
solution that is supposed to help users memorize “56 bit secrets” (for comparison, the original
NIST guideline demanded 30 bit) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2014ReliableStorage56Bits">36</a>]</span>. Users first pick a self-selected password. Their system
then displays a random code (or words) for each user at login-time which needs to be
typed correctly into a separate field. The code becomes part of the password and was
displayed with increasing delays. But participants could skip the delay by entering the code
from memory. After a median of 36 log-ins 96% of participants had memorized a 56 bit
secret. Despite the high success rates, it is questionable if this type of support is in the
users’ interest, especially if it is deployed by more than one service. In a similar vein,
Kroeze and Olivier proposed using gamification to make the training more enjoyable
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication">204</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 362--><p class="noindent" >In terms of the security flaws, mnemonic passwords are predictably based on common phrases from
movies, literature, songs, etc., but still stronger than regular passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic">206</a>]</span>. Nevertheless, Yang et
al. demonstrate that even mnemonic phrase-based passwords can be attacked easily <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYang2016MnemonicSentenceBased">381</a>]</span>. Thus,
like Zhang-Kennedy, they highlight the importance of original, personal phrases and show how
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
users can be instructed effectively.

 id="x53-1040003.3.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Passphrases</span></span>
Another technique proposed to create strong, memorable passwords is to create passphrases. Rather
than creating an acronym of a phrase, we understand them as a combination of words, e.g. the
paragon “<span 
class="ectt-1200">CorrectHorseBatteryStaple</span>”. Passphrases are usually longer than traditional
pass<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">words </span>and thus increase password strength. Paradoxically, passphrases sometimes exceed
character limits for passwords on certain websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">48</a>]</span>. The PGP system embraces the strength
benefits and uses passphrases to encrypt private keys on the clients. Keith et al. showed that
passphrases are more memorable than more complex passwords, especially if they include
punctuation symbols <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKeith2009PassphraseDesign">189</a>]</span>. However, participants in their study made significantly more errors,
which is the biggest usability caveat of long passphrases. On devices where text-entry is
cumbersome (e.g. on mobiles or smart TVs), refraining from masking entry can mitigate this
problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">232</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 369--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, Bonneau showed that user-selected passphrases are predictable <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">37</a>]</span>. To mitigate
predictable word combinations, system-assigned passphrases have been evaluated. Shay et al.
conclude that this boosts strength, but users dislike them <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">297</a>]</span>. Similarly, passphrase-centric
policies (e.g. 2word16) lead to passwords with high guess numbers, but users struggle to create
them <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>. The Diceware approach is often mentioned as a means to randomize word
selection<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss64.html#fn11x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">11</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x53-104001f11"></a>.
The user rolls a die five times and notes down the resulting numbers. Afterwards, they look up the
word with the corresponding number from the Diceware wordlist. The process should be repeated
at least twice to create a passphrase. Unfortunately, the process requires some dedication, time, and
a dice. Nonetheless, passphrases usually do not require a change to the provider’s system, which
makes them a viable, memorable and secure option, e.g. if they are mostly entered with a physical
keyboard.

href="#x53-950003.2.3">3.2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:external-storage --></a>), offer to generate passwords. Moreover, the Safari browser
suggests a randomly generated password to users and stores it into Apple’s cloud storage
Keychain. Relying on a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWMg">password manager</a> gives users a number of usability benefits
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYee2006Passpet">384</a>]</span>. As mentioned above, auto-fill reduces interaction times and recall problems. If
passwords are generated on the fly, the effort to create passwords is removed. It is easy to
generate unique passwords for each account and thwart phishing attacks, so the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>
scales with the number of accounts. Some <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWMs</a> give the users feedback to assess their
overall protection level. On the downside, users become dependent on the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>, which
makes it difficult to roam and use other devices. Even if users do not generate passwords,
they lose muscle memory with auto-fill, so it is cognitively more challenging to log in
manually.
</p><!--l. 398--><p class="noindent" >HCI researchers have tried to solve these problems. Stobert and Biddle proposed VersiPass <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PWMThatDoesntRemember">315</a>]</span>. It
uses graphical authentication and hints to avoid losing muscle memory, but it has not been
empirically evaluated. Tapas is a decentralized password manager based on two-factor
authentication, which was well received in two user studies <span class="cite">[<a

extension that lets users pick a “pet name” (label) for each website they have signed up for <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYee2006Passpet">384</a>]</span>.
The label is part of the password hashing and aims to increase both the security and memorability
of the scheme, similar to the Password Multiplier system by Halderman et al. <span class="cite">[<a

Fagan et al. investigated the reasons for (not) adopting a <a

found that users more prominently appreciate usability benefits. Those who do not use a
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a> distrusted the security, potentially due to a sub-par mental model. We can also
hypothesize that many users want to stay independent and not give away control to a third
party.
</p><!--l. 401--><p class="noindent" >In summary, password managers aid users in password selection, and scaling the increasing number

<!--l. 413--><p class="noindent" >Persuading users to behave differently is the last line of defense we shall discuss in this part. Using
technology to persuade users can be traced back to Fogg’s seminal work on “captology”, which was
later recoined under the umbrella term <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">persuasive technology </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFogg2002Persuasive">120</a>]</span>. He defines it as “<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">interactive</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">computing system designed to change people’s attitudes or behaviors</span>”. Persuasion itself is seen as
“an attempt to change attitudes or behaviors or both (without using coercion or deception)”. The
latter part further distinguishes persuasion from manipulation, where people are not aware of the
manipulator’s intentions. Password composition policies exert authority and coerce users to follow
the rules. The need for autonomy as part of the Self-Determination Theory <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRyan2000SelfDeterminationTheory">273</a>]</span> is thus
undermined by policies. User education is voluntary and often misses its goal because users
seldom decide to educate themselves on password security. Therefore, persuasion could
fill the gap of providing transparent education by making alternative behavior more
salient <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. In the context of this thesis, we thus understand persuasive technology as an
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">enabling </span>technology that adequately supports users while respecting their preferences.
Persuasion in HCI has become an essential topic with numerous papers published at top-tier
conferences. Hekler already highlighted the rising interest already in 2013 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHekler2013TheoreticalGap">160</a>]</span>. What is more,
persuasion is one of the central topics among the top-5 most cited CHI-papers of the past five
years<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss65.html#fn12x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">12</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x53-106001f12"></a>.
Consequently, we regard it as highly promising direction for password research.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x53-1080003.4.1"></a>Terminology in Persuasion and Behavioral Economics</h5>
<!--l. 420--><p class="noindent" >In the design of persuasive technology, we often encounter the concept of “nudging” people, i.e.
figuratively giving them a small push to act in a certain way <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XThaler2008Nudge">332</a>]</span>. The “choice architect” decides
on the direction of the push <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XThaler2010ChoiceArchitecture">333</a>]</span>. For instance, by setting clever <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">defaults</span>, people are relieved of
making an active decision and can just accept the default. Nudging strategies as part of “soft
paternalism” or “libertarian paternalism” stem from the field of behavioral economics, which
studies “how individual, social, cognitive, and emotional biases influence economic decisions” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAcquisti2008DigitalPrivacy">2</a>]</span>.
In other words, behavioral economists embrace the idea that people sometimes act irrationally
when making economic decisions. For example, people are significantly more likely
to purchase a glass of jam, if there are only six options instead of 24 – the so-called
“choice paradox” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XIyengar2000WhenChoiceIsDemotivating">174</a>]</span>. As we have seen in Section <a 
href="#x53-920003.2">3.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:user-behavior --></a>, password coping strategies
ultimately involve such economic decisions: Given a risk, one needs to assess the severity,
likelihood, costs of mitigating the risk, and the effectiveness of the protective measure <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSchneier2008PsychologySecurity">283</a>]</span>.
Thus, theories from behavioral economics are a useful resource that can explain user
behavior.
</p><!--l. 423--><p class="noindent" >Referring to the dual process theory, Kahneman argues that many sub-optimal decisions originate
from System 1 which is responsible for intuitive and automatic thinking processes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKahnemann2002">184</a>]</span>. System 2,
on the other hand, is the rational and effortful part in our thinking processes. He explains that
most of our thinking is carried out by System 1, because it would be impossible to put
the same amount of effort into every decision that we make (e.g. it is unnecessary to
weigh the pro’s and con’s in answering “should I brush my teeth today?”). In password
selection, both systems are involved, but depending on the context, one or the other is
primarily responsible for the decision. For instance, users who have formed the habit to
reuse one password for all accounts will do the same for the next account they create,
thus the automatic System 1 is at play. However, if the composition policy forces the
user to modify their password, the cognitive challenge rises and activates System 2.
Persuasive technology aims to either facilitate decision-making (i.e. supporting System 1), or
block automatic processes to help the user adopt a different behavior (i.e. activating
System 2). For instance, intentionally introducing delays during password authentication
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMalkin2013Waiting">219</a>]</span> or in browser warnings <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2010PleaseContinueToHold">95</a>]</span> lead to users spending more time on the task and
act more securely, probably because the interruption was enough to activate System
2.

“systematic, and therefore predictable deviations from rational choice theory” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAcquisti2017NudgesPrivacySecurity">1</a>]</span>. The resulting
behavior is neither erratic, nor irrational, but may strongly influence judgment under uncertainty
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTversky1974HeuristicsBiases">338</a>]</span>. To still be able to make decisions under uncertainty, people utilize <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">heuristics</span>, or mental
shortcuts in decision-making. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Bounded rationality </span>explains the use of heuristics with the
impracticality of assessing all possible options and outcomes. In other words, heuristics allow
making good decisions under the circumstances <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKahneman2003MapsOfBoundedRationality">182</a>]</span>. Thus, like biases, heuristics are not
necessarily bad, but even necessary to get through life <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCialdini2007Influence">57</a>]</span>. The lack of certainty is prevalent in
decisions in cybersecurity, especially for mainstream users. For example, it is hard for users to
assess the risk of threats online, and make a decision on the required protection level.
Therefore, heuristics in this domain have been investigated to better understand user behavior.
The list of cognitive fallacies is long, Wikipedia mentions 109 decision-making biases
alone<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss66.html#fn13x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">13</sup></a></span><a

To stay on topic, we explain the theories with “password phenomena”, although the scenarios have

<!--l. 441--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">sunk costs </span>fallacy describes the situation when people have made an investment under
uncertainty in the past and continue to stand by it, even if circumstances have changed and it would
be better to abandon the commitment <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XThaler2004MentalAccounting">331</a>]</span>: Imagine someone bought a (nonrefundable) ticket to
watch a movie at a theater. They dislike it from the start and after 25 minutes, they feel the movie is
not going to get better. Due to the sunk costs of the ticket and unrecoverable effort to go to the
theater, it is likely that they stick around instead of simply leaving the show. Herley et al. hint a
similar scenario for replacing password authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>. In their point of view,
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:SP">service providers</a> have invested into passwords and are now reluctant to move away to
alternative schemes, although they might improve system security (see Section <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-610002.5">2.5<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:authentication_without_pws --></a>).
Similarly, users who have committed to a password and reused it many times, might
see the time spent as sunk cost. Thus, they do not switch to a more secure alternative
even if they know there are plenty. Arguably, the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Status Quo bias </span>plays a role in both
examples, too: people tend to favor a pre-existing state of affairs over potentially uncertain
changes.
</p><!--l. 444--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">availability heuristic </span>is observed when people over- or underestimate the likelihood of
events after being exposed to salient information. For instance, users might estimate the
likelihood of being hacked as higher after someone in their social circle reports such an
incident: the possibility has become more salient and available, thus future occurrences
are seen as more probable. Das et al. partially confirmed such behavior through user
interviews <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDas2014EffectSocialInfluenceSecuritySensitivity">68</a>]</span>. Certainly, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">recency illusions </span>amplify the availability heuristic, i.e. a
user who just found out about the “hacking threat” might think that this threat had just
emerged.

passwords. A news article can anchor the reader on the strength of obvious passwords
like 12345. In many cases, their own password(s) seem much stronger by comparison,
but might not be seen as strong if assessed separately. Similarly, if many people show
insecure password behavior, this may reinforce an individual’s practices through the
<span

Zakaria et al. <span class="cite">[<a

more valuable than equivalent gains <span class="cite">[<a

normative message after a policy rejects the user’s first-chosen password might explain: “The
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
password is weak, because it is easily guessable for hackers” (emphasis on the adversary)
rather than “..., because it is something many people would choose” (emphasis on the
social in-group). If normative messages are framed badly, this can lead to the <span

<span

Behavioral economists have found it to induce irrational behavior: Kivetz et al. handed out two
different designs of “coffee cards”, that customers can fill up with each purchase <span class="cite">[<a

card is full, they can redeem it for a free coffee. One of the designs had ten stamp-fields, while the
other had twelve fields, two of which were already stamped. So, in both cases, customers
received a free coffee after ten purchases. Surprisingly, more cards with twelve fields were
redeemed after the trial period. People (wrongly) thought to be closer to goal, and thus
were more motivated to achieve it. This “goal distance model” is sometimes used by
password meters, i.e. a visualization of password strength (we discuss them in great detail
in Section <a 
href="#x53-1140003.4.3">3.4.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:password-meters --></a>). Password strength visualization can give the user a “head start” to

href="dissli2.html#XLockton2010DesignWithIntent">215</a>]</span>. Jameson et al. show how to pick strategies from
various toolkits to create a persuasive choice architecture <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XJameson2011PreferentialChoice">179</a>]</span>. Cialdini’s generic “<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">six</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">weapons of influence</span>” have been used in the design of persuasive technology <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCialdini2007Influence">57</a>]</span>. He
lists authority, scarcity, liking, social proof, commitment &#x0026; consistency, and reciprocity
as the principles of persuasion. Let us walk through their potential usage in password
authentication. The authority principle says that people are likely to follow the instructions of an
authority, which explains why the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a> guidelines have been widely adopted despite their
downsides. Scarcity drives motivation to act quickly to avoid losing an opportunity (see loss
aversion), and framing effects are used to communicate the scarcity of a resource. For
instance, the “419 scam” tactic in phishing emails frames time as a scarce resource: “your
account has been intruded, if you don’t log in now, you lose access to it permanently”
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStajano2011Principles">312</a>]</span>. In this case, persuasion is used for malicious purposes. People prefer to comply
if they <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">like </span>their counterpart. In theory, this would make password requirements less
bothersome if used on a website that users like, or in a more aesthetically pleasing way.
Although there is no empirical evidence that the principle works for registration forms
specifically, other HCI research points in this direction <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFogg2001WhatMakesSitesCredible">121</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XTractinsky2000WhatIsBeautiful">336</a>]</span>. The social proof
strategy makes other people’s behavior more <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">available </span>because in decision-making people
tend to copy others’ decisions. For instance, it might help to point out that millions of
users are already using a password manager in a news article about a new password
leak. We can also apply Fogg’s behavior model here: Reading about a password leak
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">motivates </span>users to protect themselves, the social proof strategy acts as a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">trigger</span>, and
mentioning the ease-of-use of password managers gives users confidence about their
ability to adopt a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>. The commitment &#x0026; consistency principle is an immediate part of
the Password Life Cycle <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>]</span>. People try to be consistent with their past behavior and
their past values. Thus, a small step towards breaking an insecure habit might, in fact,
induce more secure behavior afterward. If a policy forced a user to stop using a common
password, the effort to commit to the new password might spread over to other accounts,
too. Stobert found that cybersecurity experts show higher signs of consistency <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2015ExpertPassword">317</a>]</span>.
Thus, if a persuasive strategy achieves that users commit to a new password selection
scheme, their behavior might become more consistent and thus be elevated to the expert
level. Finally, reciprocity describes the desire to return a favor. To use it as a persuasive
design strategy, one has to do something favorable for the users first. Thus, offering
users to store their passwords in a secure place and automatically logging them in is a
good foundation to ask them later to turn on 2-factor authentication to help secure their

<!--l. 498--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">simplification </span>principle posits to reduce the number of tasks to achieve an overall goal. Thus,
the hypothetical distance between the start state and the goal is shorter, and goal-gradient effects
become visible. Password managers usually simplify authentication by reducing the best-case
interaction from “recall-enter-submit” to “submit”. Fagan et al. showed that simplification is the
primary reason to adopt a password manager <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFagan2017UsersConsiderationsPWMs">102</a>]</span>. But even without a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>, both the “recall” and
the “enter” sub-tasks can be simplified. Recall is facilitated with consistent personal password
strategies. Entering is easier, if the primary password is replaced by a less complex one-time
password.
</p><!--l. 501--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Personalization</span>, as understood in the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">PAF</a>, encompasses tailoring the experience to an individual
user, or to suggest actions. A recently emerged design pattern spreads out the log-in process across
two separate steps for username and password, rather than having the two input fields visible at
once. After submitting the username, the page is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">tailored </span>to the user by showing them their profile
picture and/or another piece of non-critical personal information. At the same time, this establishes
a light-weight trusted path <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYe2005TrustedPaths">383</a>]</span>. Wilkinson et al. suggest personalizing privacy by design by
giving users different levels of control to depending on their privacy profile <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWilkinson2017UserTailoredPBD">376</a>]</span>. Besides, this is
a good example of the paternalism in persuasive interventions, because the designer
suggests what option is “better” for the individual user. Similarly, it is conceivable to
personalize password policies depending on the user’s “password profile” (I elaborate on
this idea in Section <a 
href="dissch14.html#x129-40700014.1.2">14.1.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:pst:personalizing-policies --></a>). Moreover, personality constructs have been investigated
to tailor user experiences, which perhaps exceeds the original proposition in the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">PAF</a>.
Recently, Egelman and Peer advocated the use of psychometric cues to contextualize
privacy or security messaging, which they call the “next frontier in privacy and security
research” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2015AverageUser">98</a>]</span>. Jeske et al. investigated user profiles for the susceptibility to security nudges
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XJeske2014NudgingWhomHow">181</a>]</span>. In their experiment, they used <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">salience </span>to steer users away from insecure wireless
networks. They found that participants with low impulse control were more susceptible to
nudges. The finding can be interpreted that nudges directed at System 1 seem more
effective. There is also preliminary evidence that susceptibility to phishing, i.e. a social
nudge, is also related to personality <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHalevi2013PilotStudyPersonality">148</a>]</span>. It stands to reason that password selection
is related to personality, too (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>). If this were the case, a new spectrum of
personalization strategies arises. Haque et al. have already proposed a psychometric construct to
identify such associations <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHaque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword">153</a>]</span>. Forget et al. list <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">suggestion </span>as part of the personalization
dimension, because suggestions might be based on a personal context factors. They provided
a number of cases studies on suggestive password alterations <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008MemorabilityPersuasivePasswords">122</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008PersuasionStrongerPasswords">127</a>]</span>. The
“persuasive text passwords” (PTP) system takes a user’s password and either randomly inserts
characters or replaces existing characters to increase strength. The high resemblance
to the original password is supposed to maintain memorability <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008MemorabilityPersuasivePasswords">122</a>]</span>. Shay et al. later
re-evaluated this personalization approach in an <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a> study, which yielded mixed results
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 509--><p class="noindent" >Arguably, looking over users’ shoulder while they authenticate increases the chances that they comply
to security policies, given that users are aware of being observed. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Monitoring</span>, however, can entail
reduced user experience (cf. need for autonomy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRyan2000SelfDeterminationTheory">273</a>]</span>). Nevertheless, if used adequately, it can

href="dissli2.html#XCialdini2007Influence">57</a>]</span>). Google’s password
alert<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss69.html#fn16x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">16</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x53-112002f16"></a>
is a moderate approach to secure users’ Google accounts. It is a browser extension that alerts the
user if they type the password of their Google account on unrelated web pages. Hence, the idea is to
make sure users use a unique password for their Google account, which is a central hub for
various services. To work properly, the browser extension needs to access every keystroke.
Some users might distrust it because, although it is open source, it is hard for them to tell
if their private data is collected. Prospect theory tells us that in this judgment under
uncertainty, losing private data is attributed a higher value than the potential security
gain. A less privacy-invasive design element that might help in relieving uncertainty
is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">self-monitoring</span>. Self-monitoring through <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">feedback-loops </span>– another design pattern
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XLidwell2003UniversalPrinciplesOfDesign">211</a>]</span> – allows users to reflect on their past actions and derive alternatives to attain their
goal. Some <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWMs</a> create a “security score” for each user and persuade them to improve
it.
</p><!--l. 513--><p class="noindent" >Users rarely develop habits to act securely. Thus, Forget et al. argue to use various
forms of reinforcement to persuade people to develop such habits. Rewarding users
for secure password behavior serves to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">condition </span>them. Google Drive, for instance,
offered users more cloud storage quota if they completed a two-minute security
check-up<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss70.html#fn17x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">17</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x53-112003f17"></a>.
Positive feedback during password selection can condition users, too. Other rewards, e.g. longer
session expiration or faster system response, have not seen significant uptake.
</p><!--l. 516--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">PAF</a> includes <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">social interactions </span>as persuasive design strategy. Forget et
al. posit that authentication systems mimick, e.g., the users’ language to convey “team
spirit” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008PersuasionStrongerPasswords">127</a>]</span>. Weirich and Sasse <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">368</a>]</span>, respectively Sasse and Flechais <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">277</a>]</span>, similarly
describe authentication as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">socio-technical system </span>that follows a social protocol. DiGioia
and Dourish formulated the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social navigation </span>pattern <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDiGioia2005SocialNavigationUsableSecurity">86</a>]</span>. To perceive the system as
capable communication partner, signs of previous interactions inspire trust. Egelman et al.
tried to nudge users during password selection through the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social proof  </span>strategy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>. A
visualization informed the study participants how well their password fared compared to other
users, e.g. “your password is stronger than that of 85% of our users”. They did not find
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
evidence that this persuasive strategy influenced people, but maybe the approach could
have been more focused on the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">proof  </span>aspect, rather than <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">competition</span>. The normative
message can be read as “other people’s passwords are bad, but many people act this way”.
This could actually evoke backfire effects through social proof: although users see their
password is stronger, they believe that the social norm is to pick weaker passwords,
which makes them conform to the social norm. In fact, Weirich and Sasse have provided
empirical evidence for such behavior <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">368</a>]</span>. Social interactions are perhaps one of the most
powerful design elements to persuade users: Das et al. reported that radical behavior
changes often occurred due to social processes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDas2014EffectSocialInfluenceSecuritySensitivity">68</a>]</span>. They argue that it is critical for
users to observe experts in their social circle to raise their awareness and motivation for
cybersecurity. Thus, persuasive design could make expert behavior of known peers more
visible
</p><!--l. 519--><p class="noindent" >In a number of ways, some ideas from the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">Persuasive Authentication Framework</a> were rather
optimistic. From today’s point of view they appear questionable (e.g. conditioning users like
animals). Much evidence from the ten years that followed its publication shows that persuasion
does not always work as intended, so maybe a few suggestions were a bit naive. Renaud et al.
evaluated eight nudges that were supposed to make students create stronger passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">267</a>]</span>. They
reached the disheartening conclusion that none of them work. Nevertheless, certain aspects have
caught on and are actively used, like Google’s Password Alert which is a direct implementation of
Forget et al.’s ideas. We can conclude that the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PAF">PAF</a> has matured over time, with certain
components receiving more weight through empirical evidence, and others becoming
obsolete. Thus, a revision could incorporate our newly gained understanding of persuasive
authentication.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x53-1130003.4.2"></a>Dark Patterns</h5>
<!--l. 523--><p class="noindent" >At the outset of this chapter, we discussed ethics as critical factor in password studies. Using
persuasion inherently becomes ethically problematic if the intention of the influencer is concealed,
either by poor design or by choice. Persuasive techniques are used to manipulate, too. Many social
engineering scams on malicious websites use persuasion techniques. Muscanell et al. investigated
the misuse of Cialdini’s weapons of influence in cyber scams <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMuscanell2014WeaponsMisused">238</a>]</span>. They found that scammers
exploit all of them in social engineering attacks. Muscanell et al. also propose mitigation strategies,
but do not lay them out in detail. Attacks that take advantage of “scarcity” as persuasive strategy
often rely on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fear appeals</span>, e.g. “Your computer is infected, download this software <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">now </span>to
remove all threats”. Xu et al. proposed using similar fear appeals to nudge users towards
anti-spyware measures <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XXu2007FearAppeals">379</a>]</span>, and Vance et al. utilized the “time to crack” as fear appeal during
password selection <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVance2013FearAppeals">347</a>]</span>. There are a number of such “dark patterns”, which Nodder
dismantles in his book “Evil by Design” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XNodder2013EvilByDesign">243</a>]</span>. Some of them are relatively benign, others
are highly manipulative. DarkPatterns.org summarizes them briefly, e.g. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">misdirection </span>-
where the design aims to focus the user’s attention on a decoy to plant something on

href="diss71.html#fn18x13"><sup class="textsuperscript">18</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x53-113001f18"></a>.
However, Sasse strongly urges to resist them in the design of password persuasion because they
wear off over time and often exaggerate the risks <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSasse2015ScaringBullying">275</a>]</span>. Hence, dark patterns most likely turn out
counterproductive.

<!--l. 533--><p class="noindent" >The most prominent and widespread persuasive strategy directed at passwords are <a

strength meters (PSMs)</a>. Most commonly, they proactively estimate the strength of a password at
entry time and visualize it. Often, verbal feedback accompanies the visualization. They have been
used on a multitude of websites, in password managers, and as standalone tools. When
they are used on a website or in a <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWM">PWM</a>, there are a number of persuasive patterns at
play:
</p><!--l. 535--><p class="noindent" ><span

positive feedback about the user’s password can reinforce secure behavior. <span

<span

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Availability</span>
and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">salience</span>: The strength estimation makes weaknesses more salient and threats more

manner.
</p><!--l. 549--><p class="noindent" >Balancing all those strategies in a particular design has received much attention in HCI and security
research. It is hard to trace back their origins, but proactive password checks have been part of
policies since the late 1980s <span class="cite">[<a

infrastructure just for the sake of password feedback. Thus, proxies and estimators are the go-to
method.

<!--l. 553--><p class="noindent" >A number of studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of password meters. Ur et al.
explored 14 different designs, respectively settings, of password meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>]</span>: different variations
of the “bar” visualization, different stringency parameters, suggestions, and nudges. They were able
to identify significant differences in passwords strength depending on the meter. Very stringent
meters led to stronger passwords. Any kind of visual meter resulted in longer passwords, so
text-only feedback is less persuasive. Many participants in their <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a> study added another
character at the end to receive a higher rating from the meter. Qualitative feedback and usability
ratings showed that the stringent meters were unpleasant for many participants, reducing their
persuasive power. Egelman et al. investigated context factors in the effectiveness of meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>]</span>.
They found that password meters seemed to have a greater positive effect on strength, if they
were displayed on a site with higher perceived value. Participants in that study did not
“need” the password meter, but receiving feedback on highly values websites made
their importance more available. At the same time they concluded, that the design of the
meter plays an insignificant role and that social nudges do not affect strength either.
Moreover, both Ur et al.’s and Egelman et al.’s study showed that memorability was not
affected by the meters, which is a positive finding. The meter with the highest reported
effects was recently presented by Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>. After carefully evaluating the design
space for rhetorical framing of strength feedback <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEargle2015YouCanDoBetter">90</a>]</span>, they isolated the components of
password meters and compared their effectiveness. They found that textual feedback
is recommendable to create more persuasive meters. The underlying policy also has
an effect on the persuasiveness of the meter. Their final design (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>) uses
a number of persuasive elements: A visual bar to simplify communicating password
strength; text feedback about the strength; explanations about the scoring with clear calls
to action (tunneling strategy); and lastly, a personalized suggestion of an alternative
password.

<!--l. 566--><p class="noindent" >Visualizing strength is not the only way to design a password meter. Komanduri et al. crafted a sly
prototype to tell users that their passwords are predictable: their <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Telepathwords </span>system predicts the
next character the user is about to type <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKomanduri2014Telepathwords">199</a>]</span>. The rationale of the system is that users do not
mindlessly enter a weak password anymore, i.e. that the feedback should activate System 2 thinking
processes. Furthermore, realizing that the next character can be automatically guessed might evoke
fear appeal and steer people away from predictable passwords. Komanduri et al. evaluated
Telepathwords with an <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a>-study using a role-playing scenario. They found that password
created in the Telepathwords groups outperformed traditional password policies in regard to
strength and memorability. However, participants were significantly more annoyed by
Telepathwords, perhaps because of the inconvenient truth and fear appeal. Communicating
password strength with background information is another technique to persuade users. For
example, Yee et al. displayed the estimated <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">time-to-crack </span>when users selected a master password
for the PassPet <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PWMg">password manager</a> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XYee2006Passpet">384</a>]</span>. For users, it is a better call-to-action than a numeric
score like “3/5”. Vance et al. found that such fear-appeal strategies persuade users to
read password advice and modify weak passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVance2013FearAppeals">347</a>]</span>. Khern-am-nuai et al. also
measured the persuasiveness of context-based warning messages as part of the password
meter <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKhern-am-nuai2017ContextBasedMeter">194</a>]</span>. They found that participants in their <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a>-study made significantly more
changes to their initial choice when a warning was present, e.g. “Weak. We estimate
that the password you chose is among the 30,000 weakest passwords”. However, the
study suffered from a few important limitations (e.g. removing all data from users who
were unable to log-in after 30 to 60 minutes). Kroeze and Olivier proposed evolving
a Pokemon figure as users type to visualize the growth in strength <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication">204</a>]</span>. Furnell and
Esmael evaluated feedback through emojis and found positive effects on the length of
user-selected passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XFurnell2017GuidanceCompliance">129</a>]</span>. Afjan et al. allowed users to interactively explore the
visualization they had received from the password meter <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAljaffan2017PasswordSecurityVisualizer">11</a>]</span>. Ur et al. report that an animated
dancing bunny that speeds up with increasing strength was unable to nudge users more
effectively than less exciting meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>]</span>. Shay et al. tried to help users select a stronger
password through a wizard that explained mnemonic phrase-based passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>]</span>.
Besides, they compared this strategy to the insertion approach we saw in Forget et al.’s
persuasive text passwords (PTP) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>]</span>. Both approaches were generally disliked by the
participants.
</p><!--l. 574--><p class="noindent" >Apart from pure strength visualization and persuasive messages, real-time feedback can accompany
a password policy. The user sees a list of requirements and as they enter their password, they get
feedback on the aspects that have already been fulfilled, which was originally proposed by
Proctor et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XProctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions">258</a>]</span>. Although we know by now that the resulting passwords are not
necessarily strong, Shay et al. found that this kind of checklist can reduce user frustration with
policies in general <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>]</span>. Feedback is crucial if the policy utilizes blacklists to ban too
easily guessed passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">299</a>]</span>. Habib et al. evaluated Ur et al.’s data driven password
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
meter for situations where blacklists are present <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>]</span>. They found that text feedback
mitigates insecure selection especially for those users who intended to use a blacklisted
password.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x53-1170003.4.3"></a>Light and Shadow</h5>
<!--l. 578--><p class="noindent" >Evidence about the effectiveness of password meters is mixed, but Ur et al.’s strategy might be one
of the most persuasive ones, because it combines many techniques that have proven successful in
different areas of persuasion <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>. So, in certain contexts, password meters can definitely nudge
users towards more secure behavior.
</p><!--l. 580--><p class="noindent" >However, where there is light, there is also shadow. Meters influence users’ mental models of
password strength in similar ways as policies. However, as with policies, it is nearly impossible to
reach consensus on all parameters of pro-active measures and metrics for all contexts. De
Carné de Carnavalet and Mannan showed that the estimation algorithms in real-world
password meters largely differ, which is a result of the natural constraints of pro-active
checks <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XDeCarnedeCarnavalet2015PasswordMeters">73</a>]</span>. Such inconsistencies, which were also observed by Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>]</span>, have big
potential to confuse users: if their password is rated “strong” on one site, and “weak”
on another, a lot of explanation is going to be necessary to let the users find out why
the ratings differ. Persuasive interventions probably fail at that moment. The authors
suggest zxcvbn as the most robust password meter for websites and the KeePass meter
as an alternative for offline tools. Others have addressed the shortcomings of industry
password meters. Wang et al. developed <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fuzzyPSM </span>based on an optimized version of
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PCFG">PCFG</a> <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XWang2016fuzzyPWM">360</a>]</span>. Melicher et al. implemented their neural network strength estimation in
password meters, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">233</a>]</span>. Tupsamudre et al. demonstrated that a sudden surge of n-gram
scores can be used to proactively detect modifications of common passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XTupsamudre2016MarkovStrength">337</a>]</span>.
Improvements will continue to surface, but in recent years we can at least observe a trend towards
more homogeneous strength estimation due to the gained knowledge about guessing
attacks.

<!--l. 585--><p class="noindent" >Persuasive interventions help to shape user behavior and facilitate decision-making processes.
Many influence strategies have been empirically shown to persuade people across a variety of
domains <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHamari2014DoPersuasiveTechnologies">150</a>]</span>. Thus, I believe in its feasibility for the design of secure and systems. Naturally, not
all interventions work in the same ways for all users. Still, persuasive technology asserts the claim
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
to be in the users “best interest” and wants to enable them to make “better” decisions. Thus, before
any intervention, we have to be sure to do the right thing, if changing user behavior and attitudes is
the ultimate goal. I follow Acquisiti et al.’s definition, and find that good decisions “minimize
adverse outcomes or are less likely to be regretted” <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAcquisti2017NudgesPrivacySecurity">1</a>]</span>. With this goal in mind, we can set out to
better understand the constraints and create novel persuasive strategies which are the focus of this
thesis.
