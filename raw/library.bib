abstract = {Web users are shown an invalid certificate warning when their browser cannot validate the identity of the websites they are visiting. While these warn- ings often appear in benign situations, they can also signal a man-in-the-middle attack. We conducted a survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their reactions to and understanding of current SSL warn- ings. We then designed two new warnings using warn- ings science principles and lessons learned from the survey. We evaluated warnings used in three pop- ular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100- participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our warnings performed significantly better than exist- ing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our re- sults suggest that, while warnings can be improved, a better approach may be to minimize the use of SSL warnings altogether by blocking users from making unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in be- nign situations.},

@inproceedings{Singh2007PasswordSharing,
abstract = {Current systems for banking authentication require that customers not reveal their access codes, even to members of the family. A study of banking and security in Australia shows that the practice of sharing passwords does not conform to this requirement. For married and de facto couples, password sharing is seen as a practical way of managing money and a demonstration of trust. Sharing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) is a common practice among remote indigenous communities in Australia. In areas with poor banking access, this is the only way to access cash. People with certain disabilities have to share passwords with carers, and PIN numbers with retail clerks. In this paper we present the findings of a qualitative user study of banking and money management. We suggest design criteria for banking security systems, based on observed social and cultural practices of password and PIN number sharing.},

abstract = {Online communities of different types have become an important part of the daily internet life of many people within the last couple of years. Both research and business have shown interest in studying the possibilities and risks related to these relatively new phenomena. Frequently discussed aspects that are tightly bound to online communities are their implications and effects on privacy issues. Available literature has shown that users generally disclose very much (private) information on such communities, and different factors influencing this behaviour were identified and studied. However, the influence and predictive power of personality traits on information disclosure in online communities has not yet been the subject of analysis. In this paper we report the results of an online survey investigating the relations between personality traits (based on the Fife-Factor Model), usage patterns and information disclosure of participants in different types of online communities.},

abstract = {With so much of our lives digital, online, and not entirely under our control, we risk losing access to our communications, reputation, and data. Recent years have brought a rash of high-profile account compromises, but account hijacking is not limited to high-profile accounts. In this paper, we report results of a survey about people's experiences with and attitudes toward account hijacking. The problem is widespread; 30{\%} of our 294 participants had an email or social networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five themes emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to victims, (3) users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their accounts secure, (4) users' understanding of important security measures is incomplete, and (5) harm from account hijacking is concrete and emotional. We discuss implications for designing security mechanisms to improve chances for user adoption.},

Our goal is to show how choice architecture can be used to help nudge people to make better choices (as judged by themselves) without forcing certain outcomes upon anyone, a philosophy we call libertarian paternalism. The tools we highlight are: defaults, expecting error, understanding mappings, giving feedback, structuring complex choices, and creating incentives.},

@inproceedings{Herley2008ProfitlessEndeavor,
abstract = {Conventional wisdom is that phishing represents easy money. In this paper we examine the economics that underly the phenomenon, and find a very different pic- ture. Phishing is a classic example of tragedy of the commons, where there is open access to a resource that has limited ability to regenerate. Since each phisher in- dependently seeks to maximize his return, the resource is over-grazed and yields far less than it is capable of. The situation stabilizes only when the average phisher is making only as much as he gives up in opportunity cost. Since the picture we paint is at variance with accepted wisdom we check against several publicly available data sources on phishing. We find the oft-quoted survey- based estimates of phishing losses unreliable. In par- ticular the victimization rate found in most surveys is smaller than the margin of error, and dollar losses are estimated by averaging unverified self-reported num- bers. We estimate that recent public estimates over- state phishing losses by as much as a factor of fifty. This economic portrait illuminates our enemy in an entirely new light. Far from being a path to riches, phishing appears to be a low-skill low-reward business. The enormous amount of phishing activity is evidence of its failure to deliver riches rather than its success, as phishers send more and more email hoping for their share of the bounty that eludes them. Repetition of questionable survey results and unsubstantiated anec- dotes makes things worse by ensuring a steady supply of new entrants.},

@article{Tversky1973,
abstract = {This paper explores a judgmental heuristic in which a person evaluates the frequency of classes or the probability of events by availability, i.e., by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind. In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Herley2009SoLongThanksExternalities,
abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100{\%} of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01{\%} of them a modest annual pain.},

@inproceedings{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp,
abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

abstract = {Under certain circumstances, consumers are willing to pay a premium for privacy. We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users' stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

abstract = {In our usability study of phishing attacks and browser antiphishing defenses, 27 users each classified 12 web sites as fraudulent or legitimate. By dividing these users into three groups, our controlled study measured both the effect of extended validation certificates that appear only at legitimate sites and the effect of reading a help file about security features in Internet Explorer 7. Across all groups, we found that picture-in-picture attacks showing a fake browser window were as effective as the best other phishing technique, the homograph attack. Extended validation did not help users identify either attack. Additionally, reading the help file made users more likely to classify both real and fake web sites as legitimate when the phishing warning did not appear.},

@article{Dix2004HCI,
abstract = {Much has changed since the first EDITION of humancomputer interaction was published. Ubiquitous computing and rich sensor-filled environments are finding their way out of the laboratory, not just into movies but also into our workplaces and homes. The computer has broken out of its plastic and glass bounds providing us with networked societies where personal computing devices from mobile phones to smart cards fill our pockets and electronic devices surround us at home and work. The web too has grown from a largely academic network into the hub of business and everyday lives. As the distinctions between the physical and the digital, and between work and leisure start to break down, human-computer interaction is also changing radically. The excitement of these changes is captured in this new EDITION, which also looks forward to other emerging technologies. However, the book is firmly rooted in strong principles and models indepENDent of the passing technologies of the day: these foundations will be the means by which today's students will understand tomorrow's technology. The third EDITION of humancomputer interaction can be used for introductory and advanced courses on HCI, Interaction Design, Usability or Interactive Systems Design. It will also prove an invaluable reference for professionals wishing to design usable computing devices. Accompanying the text is a comprehensive website containing a broad range of material for instructors, students and practitioners, a full text search facility for the book, links to many sites of additional interest and much more: go to www.hcibook.com New to this EDITION: bull; bull;A revised structure, reflecting the growth of HCI as a discipline, separates out basic material suitable for introductory courses from more detailed models and theories. bull;New chapter on Interaction Design adds material on scenarios and basic navigation design. bull;New chapter on Universal Design, substantially extENDing the coverage of this material in the book. bull;Updated and extENDed treatment of socio/contextual issues. bull;ExtENDed and new material on novel interaction, including updated ubicomp material, designing experience, physical sensors and a new chapter on rich interaction. bull;Updated material on the web including dynamic content and WAP.

@article{Kahneman2003MapsOfBoundedRationality,
abstract = {Economists often criticize psychological research for its propensity to generate lists of errors and biases, and for its failure to offer a coherent alternative to the rational-agent model. The present treatment distinguishes two modes of thinking and deciding, which correspond roughly to the everyday concepts of reasoning and intuition. In the examples discussed, intuition was associated with poor performance, but intuitive thinking can also be powerful and accurate. A defining property of intuitive thoughts is that they come to mind spontaneously, like percepts. The evaluation of stimuli as good or bad is a particularly important natural assessment. A general property of perceptual systems is that they are designed to enhance the accessibility of changes and differences. Perception is reference-dependent: the perceived attributes of a focal stimulus reflect the contrast between that stimulus and a context of prior and concurrent stimuli. The assumption that preferences are not affected by inconsequential variations in the description of outcomes has been called extensionality and invariance, and is considered an essential aspect of rationality.},

A client component on users' machines recorded a variety of password strength, usage and frequency metrics. This allows us to measure or estimate such quantities as the average number of passwords and average number of accounts each user has, how many passwords she types per day, how often passwords are shared among sites, and how often they are forgotten. We get extremely detailed data on password strength, the types and lengths of passwords chosen, and how they vary by site. The data is the first large scale study of its kind, and yields numerous other insights into the role the passwords play in users' online experience.},

@inproceedings{Davis2004UserChoiceGraphical,
abstract = {Graphical password schemes have been proposed as an alternative to text passwords in applications that support graphics and mouse or stylus entry. In this paper we detail what is, to our knowledge, the largest published empirical evaluation of the effects of user choice on the security of graphical password schemes. We show that permitting user selection of passwords in two graphical password schemes, one based directly on an existing commercial product, can yield passwords with entropy far below the theoretical optimum and, in some cases, that are highly correlated with the race or gender of the user. For one scheme, this effect is so dramatic so as to render the scheme insecure. A conclusion of our work is that graphical password schemes of the type we study may generally require a different posture toward password selection than text passwords, where selection by the user remains the norm today.},

@inproceedings{Singh2007PasswordSharing,
abstract = {Current systems for banking authentication require that customers not reveal their access codes, even to members of the family. A study of banking and security in Australia shows that the practice of sharing passwords does not conform to this requirement. For married and de facto couples, password sharing is seen as a practical way of managing money and a demonstration of trust. Sharing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) is a common practice among remote indigenous communities in Australia. In areas with poor banking access, this is the only way to access cash. People with certain disabilities have to share passwords with carers, and PIN numbers with retail clerks. In this paper we present the findings of a qualitative user study of banking and money management. We suggest design criteria for banking security systems, based on observed social and cultural practices of password and PIN number sharing.},

@article{Barbera2013,
abstract = {The ever increasing ubiquitousness of WiFi access points, coupled with the diffusion of smartphones, suggest that Internet every time and everywhere will soon (if not already has) become a reality. Even in presence of 3G connectivity, our devices are built to switch automatically to WiFi networks so to improve user experience. Most of the times, this is achieved by recurrently broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), like, e.g., "Home WiFi", "Campus WiFi", and so on. In a large gathering of people, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario rises a natural question: "Can significant information on the social structure of a large crowd and on its socioeconomic status be inferred by looking at smartphone probes?". In this work we give a positive answer to this question. We organized a 3-months long campaign, through which we collected around 11M probes sent by more than 160K different devices. During the campaign we targeted national and international events that attracted large crowds as well as other gatherings of people. Then, we present a simple and automatic methodology to build the underlying social graph of the smartphone users, starting from their probes. We do so for each of our target events, and find that they all feature social-network properties. In addition, we show that, by looking at the probes in an event, we can learn important sociological aspects of its participants---language, vendor adoption, and so on.},

Moreover, factors that would be expected to affect normative action were influential only when the norm was focal. These factors included the degree to which the action violated the relevant norm (Study 2) and the degree to which an individual subscribed to that norm (Study 3).

@inproceedings{Inglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies,
abstract = {HCI research published 10 years ago pointed out that many users cannot cope with the number and complexity of passwords, and resort to insecure workarounds as a consequence. We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

@incollection{Aljaffan2017PasswordSecurityVisualizer,
abstract = {This paper presents the Password Security Visualizer (PSV), an interactive visualization system specifically designed for password se-curity education. PSV can be seen as a reconfigurable " box " containing different proactive password checkers (PPCs) and visualizers of password security information, allowing it to be used like a " many in one " or " hy-brid " PPC. PSV can provide many new features that do not exist in traditional PPCs, thus having a greater potential to achieve its goals of educating users. Using purely client-side Web-based technologies, we implemented a prototype of PSV as an open-source software tool on a 2-D animated canvas. To evaluate the actual performance of our imple-mented PSV prototype against traditional PPCs, we conducted a semi-structured interview involving 20 human participants. Our qualitative analysis of the results showed that PSV was considered the most in-formative and recommended by most participants as a good educational tool. To the best of our knowledge, PSV is the first system combining dif-ferent PPCs together for user education, and the user study is the first of this kind on comparing educational effectiveness of different PPCs (and PPC-like password security tools such as PSV).},

In terms of security, they are rather weak since the shapes are easy to steal and reproduce. In this work, we introduce an implicit authentication approach that en-hances password patterns with an additional security layer, transparent to the user. In short, users are not only authenti-cated by the shape they input but also by the way they per-form the input. We conducted two consecutive studies, a lab and a long-term study, using Android applications to collect and log data from user input on a touch screen of standard commercial smartphones. Analyses using dynamic time warping (DTW) provided first proof that it is actually possi-ble to distinguish different users and use this information to increase security of the input while keeping the convenience for the user high.},

@inproceedings{Maurer2011DataTypeWarnings,
abstract = {When browsing the Internet, users are likely to be exposed to security and privacy threats – like fraudulent websites. Automatic browser mechanisms can protect them only to some extent. In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

@inproceedings{Gaw2006PasswordManagement,
abstract = {Given the widespread use of password authentication in on- line correspondence, subscription services, and shopping, there is growing concern about identity theft. When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

@article{Gulenko2014PasswordsEmotion,
abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to study the influence of emotions on security behaviour by reviewing Information Systems Security (ISS) topics in Information Systems (IS) literature. Researchers in ISS study how to motivate people to adhere to security policies; they mainly focus on cognitive models such as the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1985), innovation diffusion theory (Brancheau and Wetherbe, 1990), theory of planned behaviour (Mathieson, 1991) and social cognitive theory (Compeau and Higgins, 1995). Applying positive emotions such as joy and interest is feasible by adding emoticons and positive messages; we use this approach to improve password choosing. Design/methodology/approach – We apply differential emotional theory (Izard 2002) from psychology to the context of ISS. Twenty-two participants took part in an experiment with the task of choosing strong but memorable passphrases. The dependent variable is the strength of the chosen passphrase. The task for the user is to come up with a passphrase that is both strong and memorable. We choose a between-subject design. The independent variable is the emotional interface that the user is confronted with. Findings – We found that 5.35 words was the mean when participants were shown positive smiley faces and messages. When exposed to negative emoticons, the mean was only 4.35 words. Through ANOVA, we find the differences to be statistically significant (F1; 20?3.16; p?0.1). We derive from the experiment that positive emotions should be used in ISS when making users start a habit (e.g. developing a new, individual password strategy), and we conclude from our literature review that negative emotions should be used when reinforcing a habit (e.g. taking care of shoulder surfing). Originality/value – We contribute to practice by developing a user script that can be installed in all established Internet browsers. The script supports the user to choose a good passphrase strategy when registering for a new service.Wefind that trainings should not rely on facts only but must make use of emotions, which are crucial for human motivation.

We adjusted the experimental design to mitigate some of the limitations of that prior study; adjustments include allowing participants to use their web browser of choice and recruiting a more representative user sample. However, during our study we observed a strong disparity between our participants actions during the laboratory tasks and their self-reported "would be" actions during similar tasks in everyday computer practices. Our participants attributed this disparity to the laboratory environment and the security it offered. In this paper we discuss our results and how the introduced changes to the initial study design may have affected them. Also, we discuss the challenges of observing natural behavior in a study environment, as well as the challenges of replicating previous studies given the rapid changes in web technology. We also propose alternatives to traditional laboratory study methodologies that can be considered by the usable security research community when investigating research questions involving sensitive data where trust may influence behavior.},

This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23{\%} of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40{\%} of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},

@unpublished{Sasse2005UsabilityTrust,
abstract = {The need for people to protect themselves and their assets is as old as humankind. People's physical safety and their possessions have always been at risk from deliberate attack or accidental damage. The advance of information technology means that many individuals, as well as corporations, have an additional range of physical (equipment) and electronic (data) assets that are at risk. Furthermore, the increased number and types of interactions in cyberspace has enabled new forms of attack on people and their possessions. Consider grooming of minors in chat-rooms, or Nigerian email cons: minors were targeted by paedophiles before the creation of chat-rooms, and Nigerian criminals sent the same letters by physical mail or fax before there was email. But the technology has decreased the cost of many types of attacks, or the degree of risk for the attackers. At the same time, cyberspace is still new to many people, which means they do not understand risks, or recognise the signs of an attack, as readily as they might in the physical world. The IT industry has developed a plethora of security mechanisms, which could be used to mitigate risks or make attacks significantly more difficult. Currently, many people are either not aware of these mechanisms, or are unable or unwilling or to use them. Security experts have taken to portraying people as "the weakest link" in their efforts to deploy effective security [e.g. Schneier, 2000]. However, recent research has revealed at least some of the problem may be that security mechanisms are hard to use, or be ineffective. The review summarises current research on the usability of security mechanisms, and discusses options for increasing their usability and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

@article{Proctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions,
abstract = {Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

abstract = {This paper studies the security and memorability of free-form multitouch gestures for mobile authentication. Towards this end, we collected a dataset with a generate-test-retest paradigm where participants (N=63) generated free-form gestures, repeated them, and were later retested for memory. Half of the participants decided to generate one-finger gestures, and the other half generated multi-finger gestures. Although there has been recent work on template-based gestures, there are yet no metrics to analyze security of either template or free-form gestures. For example, entropy-based metrics used for text-based passwords are not suitable for capturing the security and memorability of free-form gestures. Hence, we modify a recently proposed metric for analyzing information capacity of continuous full-body movements for this purpose. Our metric computed estimated mutual information in repeated sets of gestures. Surprisingly, one-finger gestures had higher average mutual information. Gestures with many hard angles and turns had the highest mutual information. The best-remembered gestures included signatures and simple angular shapes. We also implemented a multitouch recognizer to evaluate the practicality of free-form gestures in a real authentication system and how they perform against shoulder surfing attacks. We discuss strategies for generating secure and memorable free-form gestures. We conclude that free-form gestures present a robust method for mobile authentication.},

In response to this threat, password composition policies have grown increasingly complex. However, there is insufficient research defining metrics to characterize password strength and using them to evaluate password-composition policies. In this paper, we analyze 12,000 passwords collected under seven composition policies via an online study. We develop an efficient distributed method for calculating how effectively several heuristic password-guessing algorithms guess passwords. Leveraging this method, we investigate (a) the resistance of passwords created under different conditions to guessing, (b) the performance of guessing algorithms under different training sets, (c) the relationship between passwords explicitly created under a given composition policy and other passwords that happen to meet the same requirements, and (d) the relationship between guess ability, as measured with password-cracking algorithms, and entropy estimates. Our findings advance understanding of both password-composition policies and metrics for quantifying password security.},

@inproceedings{Dhamija2005DynamicSecuritySkins,
abstract = {Phishing is a model problem for illustrating usability concerns of privacy and security because both system designers and attackers battle using user interfaces to guide (or misguide) users. We propose a new scheme, Dynamic Security Skins, that allows a remote web server to prove its identity in a way that is easy for a human user to verify and hard for an attacker to spoof. We describe the design of an extension to the Mozilla Firefox browser that implements this scheme. We present two novel interaction techniques to prevent spoofing. First, our browser extension provides a trusted window in the browser dedicated to username and password entry. We use a photographic image to create a trusted path between the user and this window to prevent spoofing of the window and of the text entry fields. Second, our scheme allows the remote server to generate a unique abstract image for each user and each transaction. This image creates a “skin” that automatically customizes the browser window or the user interface elements in the content of a remote web page. Our extension allows the user's browser to independently compute the image that it expects to receive from the server. To authenticate content from the server, the user can visually verify that the images match. We contrast our work with existing anti-phishing proposals. In contrast to other proposals, our scheme places a very low burden on the user in terms of effort, memory and time. To authenticate himself, the user has to recognize only one image and remember one low entropy password, no matter how many servers he wishes to interact with. To authenticate content from an authenticated server, the user only needs to perform one visual matching operation to compare two images. Furthermore, it places a high burden of effort on an attacker to spoof customized security indicators.},

abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks as well as affect user behavior on social networks. This study examines the correlation between the Big Five personality traits and email phishing response. Another aspect examined is how these factors relate to users' tendency to share information and protect their privacy on Facebook (which is one of the most popular social networking sites). This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users. The goal of this study is to better understand the traits that contribute to online vulnerability, for the purpose of developing customized user interfaces and secure awareness education, designed to increase users' privacy and security in the future.},

This attack method, commonly known as “phishing,” is most commonly initiated by sending out emails with links to spoofed websites that harvest information. We present a method for detecting these attacks, which in its most gen- eral form is an application of machine learning on a fea- ture set designed to highlight user-targeted deception in electronic communication. This method is applicable, with slight modification, to detection of phishing websites, or the emails used to direct victims to these sites. We evaluate this method on a set of approximately 860 such phishing emails, and 6950 non-phishing emails, and correctly identify over 96{\%} of the phishing emails while only mis-classifying on the order of 0.1{\%} of the legitimate emails. We conclude with thoughts on the future for such techniques to specifi- cally identify deception, specifically with respect to the evo- lutionary nature of the attacks and information available.},

abstract = {Automated teller machine (ATM) frauds are increasing drastically these days. When analyzing the most common attacks and the reasons for successful frauds, it becomes apparent that the main problem lies in the PIN based authentication which in itself does not provide any security features (besides the use of asterisks). That is, security is solely based on a user's behavior. Indirect input is one way to solve this problem. This mostly comes at the costs of adding overhead to the input process. We present ColorPIN, an authentication mechanism that uses indirect input to provide security enhanced PIN entry. At the same time, ColorPIN remains a one-to-one relationship between the length of the PIN and the required number of clicks. A user study showed that ColorPIN is significantly more secure than standard PIN entry while enabling good authentication speed in comparison with related systems.},

Only in recent years has the security research community acknowledged that user behavior plays a part in many security failures, and that policies alone may not be sufficient to ensure correct behavior. We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind. We present the results of a first study that can guide such persuasive efforts, and describe methods that can be used to persuade users to employ proper password practice.},

@article{Brustoloni2007,
abstract = {Context-sensitive guidance (CSG) can help users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask the user to provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security dialogs irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic dialogs continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. Audited dialogs thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic dialogs. Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited dialogs. In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional dialogs. Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks.},

abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

@inproceedings{Yang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity,
abstract = {Text-based passwords continue to be the prime form of authentication to computer systems. Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile text entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to traditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable security: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password security. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and probabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed cracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect of text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental groups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password than the control group ({\$}t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004{\$}). The choices for character types in each group were also significantly different ({\$}p=0.048, FET{\$}). Our cracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across groups ({\$}p=0.031, FET{\$}) and text entry method vulnerabilities. Our findings contribute to the understanding of password security in the context of usable interfaces.},

@article{Wash2015,
abstract = {Home computers are frequently the target of malicious attackers because they are usually administered by non-experts. Prior work has found that users who make security decisions about their home computers often possess different mental models of information security threats, and use those mental models to make decisions about security. Using a survey, we asked a large representative sample of United States Internet users about different causal beliefs related to computer security, and about the actions they regularly undertake to protect their computers. We found demographic differences in both beliefs about security and security behaviors that pose challenges for helping users become more informed about security. Many participants reported weakly held beliefs about viruses and hackers, and these were the least likely to say they take protective actions. These results suggest that all security knowledge is not the same, educating users about security is not simply a more-is-better issue, and not all users should receive the same messages.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of organizations allowing per- sonal smart phones onto their networks, considerable secu- rity risk is introduced. The security risk is exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices and their respective installed pool of applications. Further- more, by virtue of the devices not being owned by the orga- nization, the ability to authoritatively enforce organizational security polices is challenging. As a result, a critical part of organizational security is the ability to drive user security behavior through either on-device mechanisms or security awareness programs. In this paper, we establish a base- line for user security behavior from a population of over one hundred fifty smart phone users. We then systematically evaluate the ability to drive behavioral change via messag- ing centered on morality, deterrence, and incentives. Our findings suggest that appeals to morality are most effective over time, whereas deterrence produces the most immediate reaction. Additionally, our findings show that while a sig- nificant portion of users are securing their devices without prior intervention, it is difficult to influence change in those who do not.},

These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better-that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited. Implications for future research are discussed.},

abstract = {OpenID and InfoCard are two mainstream Web single sign- on (SSO) solutions intended for Internet-scale adoption. While they are technically sound, the business model of these solu- tions does not provide content-hosting and service providers (CSPs) with sucient incentives to become relying parties (RPs). In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adop- tion for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must of- fer RPs sucient business incentives and trustworthy iden- tity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks. Moreover, we propose that Web SSO technol- ogy should build identity support into browsers in order to facilitate RPs' adoption.},

This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher interjudge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.},

abstract = {Challenging the conventional wisdom that users cannot remember cryptographically-strong secrets, we test the hypothesis that users can learn randomly-assigned 56- bit codes (encoded as either 6 words or 12 characters) through spaced repetition. We asked remote research participants to perform a distractor task that required log- ging into a website 90 times, over up to two weeks, with a password of their choosing. After they entered their chosen password correctly we displayed a short code (4 letters or 2 words, 18.8 bits) that we required them to type. For subsequent logins we added an increasing de- lay prior to displaying the code, which participants could avoid by typing the code from memory. As participants learned, we added two more codes to comprise a 56.4- bit secret. Overall, 94{\%} of participants eventually typed their entire secret from memory, learning it after a me- dian of 36 logins. The learning component of our system added a median delay of just 6.9 s per login and a to- tal of less than 12 minutes over an average of ten days. 88{\%} were able to recall their codes exactly when asked at least three days later, with only 21{\%} reporting having written their secret down. As one participant wrote with surprise, “the words are branded into my brain.” While our study is preliminary in nature, we believe it debunks the myth that users are inherently incapable of remem- bering cryptographically-strong secrets for a select few high-stakes scenarios, such as a password for enterprise login or as a master key to protect other credentials (e.g., in a password manager).},

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

We present persuasion profiling as a method to personalize the persuasive messages used by a system to influence its users. This type of personalization can be based on explicit measures of users' tendencies to comply to distinct persuasive strategies: measures based on standardized questionnaire scores of users. However, persuasion profiling can also be implemented using implicit, behavioral measures of user traits. We present three case studies involving the design, implementation, and field deployment of personalized persuasive technologies, and we detail four design requirements. In each case study we show how these design requirements are implemented. In the discussion we highlight avenues for future research in the field of adaptive persuasive technologies.},

@inproceedings{Carnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters,
abstract = {Millions of users are exposed to password-strength meters/checkers at highly popular web services that use user- chosen passwords for authentication. Recent studies have found evidence that some meters actually guide users to choose better passwords—which is a rare bit of good news in password research. However, these meters are mostly based on ad-hoc design. At least, as we found, most vendors do not provide any explanation of their design choices, sometimes making them appear to be a black box. We analyze password meters deployed in selected popular websites, by measuring the strength labels assigned to common passwords from several password dictio- naries. From this empirical analysis with millions of passwords, we report prominent characteristics of meters as deployed at popular websites. We shed light on how the server-end of some meters functions, provide examples of highly inconsistent strength outcomes for the same password in different meters, along with examples of many weak passwords being labeled as strong or even very strong. These weaknesses and inconsistencies may confuse users in choosing a stronger password, and thus may weaken the purpose of these meters. On the other hand, we believe these findings may help improve existing meters, and possibly make them an effective tool in the long run. I.},

abstract = {Background: Human beings are an integral part of com-puter security, whether we actively participate or simply build the systems. Despite this importance, understand-ing users and their interaction with security is a blind spot for most security practitioners and designers. Aim: Define principles for conducting experiments into usable security and privacy, to improve study robustness and usefulness. Data: The authors' experiences conducting several re-search projects complemented with a literature survey. Method: We extract principles based on relevance to the advancement of the state of the art. We then justify our choices by providing published experiments as cases of where the principles are and are not followed in practice to demonstrate the impact. Each principle is a discipline-specific instantiation of desirable experiment-design ele-ments as previously established in the domain of philos-ophy of science. Results: Five high-priority principles – (i) give par-ticipants a primary task; (ii) incorporate realistic risk; (iii) avoid priming the participants; (iv) perform double-blind experiments whenever possible and (v) think care-fully about how meaning is assigned to the terms threat model, security, privacy, and usability. Conclusion: The principles do not replace researcher acumen or experience, however they can provide a valu-able service for facilitating evaluation, guiding younger researchers and students, and marking a baseline com-mon language for discussing further improvements.},

We identify four key security concerns for web-based pass- word managers and, for each, identify representative vul- nerabilities through our case studies. Our attacks are se- vere: in four out of the five password managers we stud- ied, an attacker can learn a user's credentials for arbi- trary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared pass- words. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also di- verse: ranging from logic and authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in ad- dition to the typical vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure. To guide future de- velopment of password managers, we provide guidance for password managers. Given the diversity of vulner- abilities we identified, we advocate a defense-in-depth approach to ensure security of password managers},

abstract = {Given the widespread use of password authentication in on- line correspondence, subscription services, and shopping, there is growing concern about identity theft. When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

We have developed Versipass, a password manager that incorporates key elements of password managers and cued graphical pass- words to avoid existing problems of password memorabil- ity and associating passwords with accounts. Instead of re- membering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better re- member their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.},

abstract = {We present the results of an experiment examining the extent to which individuals will tolerate delays when told that such delays are for security purposes. In our experiment, we asked 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk users to count the total number of times a certain term was repeated in a multi-page document. The task was designed to be conducive to cheating. We assigned subjects to four between-subjects conditions: one of these offered a concrete security reason (virus-scanning) for the delay, another offered only a vague security explanation, another did not mention security at all, and a control condition without a delay. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to cheat or abandon the task when provided no explanation or a vague security explanation for the delay. However, when subjects were provided more explanation about the threat model and the protection ensured by the delay, they were not more likely to cheat than subjects in the control condition who faced no such delay. Our results thus contribute to the nascent literature on soft paternalistic solutions to security and privacy problems by suggesting that, when security mitigations cannot be made “free” for users, designers may incentivize compliant users' behavior by intentionally drawing attention to the mitigation itself.},

The lack of adoption of privacy enhancing technologies is explained as a societal failure, i.e., that people don??t care. Security designers consider the individual user to be rational, certain, and self-optimizing. Thus, academic and practitioner efforts have focused on incentive alignment and education. But even the effectiveness of initiatives such as security education can be improved if well-known human decision heuristics are taken as initial inputs to improve technical solutions, rather than sources of failure to be bemoaned.},

We used Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome's in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Fire- fox's malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google Chrome's malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox's SSL warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies acrosswarnings. In con- trast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2{\%} of Google Chrome's SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can have a significant impact on user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers.},

abstract = {When browsing the Internet, users are likely to be exposed to security and privacy threats – like fraudulent websites. Automatic browser mechanisms can protect them only to some extent. In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

We have developed Versipass, a password manager that incorporates key elements of password managers and cued graphical pass- words to avoid existing problems of password memorabil- ity and associating passwords with accounts. Instead of re- membering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better re- member their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.},

- the authors propose a system that lets the users choose their own authentication scheme.
- available schemes: Persuasive Text Passwords, Persuasive Cued Click Points, object passtiles, text passwords (baseline)
2. How did they do it?
- the conducted a small, 2 week user study with 39 participants who were prompted to log in to web sites from the MVP web-auth framework (see [5]). 

3. What was their goal?
- find evidence for/against hypotheses: h1: user do not prefer one over the other; h2: the users first take the time to learn sth about the available schemes; h3: users like CYOA

4. What are the results?
- surprise surprise: all hypotheses were confirmed. 
- users avoided Persuasive Text Password for their second account. 
- no preference of text passwords
- when people tried out a novel scheme, they switched back to text passwords and vice versa.
- users who spend more time reading the intro, were more likely to use novel schemes.
- users don't base their choice on security concerns.
- users did not switch their chosen scheme when resetting.

5. What could be improved?
- the conclusions are clearly flawed.
- the participants simply were open-minded study participants who also would behave differently in real life. 
- the statistics are traditional hypothesis tests that cannot be taken too seriously with this N
- within two weeks for artificial, uninteresting accounts it's no surprise that users did not reset their passwords / schemes. 
- the chosen schemes were all published by the authors and no one else likes them. authors were clearly biased in favor of them. 

Ah. The idea is great, but I really hate how they put it into practice and what they claim with their study. They could have done better.

@article{Kumaraguru2010TeachingJohnny,
abstract = {Phishing attacks, in which criminals lure Internet users to Web sites that spoof legitimate Web sites, are occurring with increasing frequency and are causing considerable harm to victims. While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks. Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called “PhishGuru” and an online game called “Anti-Phishing Phil” that teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.},

Specifically, several researchers have shown how different online privacy decisions are correlated with the " Big Five " personality traits. However, in our own research, we show that the five factor model is actually a weak predictor of privacy preferences and behaviors, and that other well-studied individual differences in the psychol-ogy literature are much stronger predictors. We describe the results of several experiments that showed how decision-making style and risk-taking attitudes are strong predictors of privacy attitudes, as well as a new scale that we devel-oped to measure security behavior intentions. Finally, we show that privacy and security attitudes are correlated, but orthogonal.},

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

All common mobile platforms and many desktop systems now support emoji entry and users have embraced their use. Yet, we currently know very little about what makes for good emoji entry. While soft keyboards for text entry are well optimized, based on language and touch models, no such information exists to guide the design of emoji keyboards. In this article, we investigate of the problem of emoji entry, starting with a study of the current state of the emoji keyboard implementation in Android. To enable moving forward to novel emoji keyboard designs, we then explore a model for emoji similarity that is able to inform such designs. This semantic model is based on data from 21 million collected tweets containing emoji. We compare this model against a solely description-based model of emoji in a crowdsourced study. Our model shows good performance in capturing detailed relationships between emoji.},

@article{Wood2007,
abstract = {The present model outlines the mechanisms underlying habitual control of responding and the ways in which habits interface with goals. Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between responses and the features of performance contexts that have historically covaried with them (e.g., physical settings, preceding actions). Once a habit is formed, perception of contexts triggers the associated response without a mediating goal. Nonetheless, habits interface with goals. Constraining this interface, habit associations accrue slowly and do not shift appreciably with current goal states or infrequent counterhabitual responses. Given these constraints, goals can (a) direct habits by motivating repetition that leads to habit formation and by promoting exposure to cues that trigger habits, (b) be inferred from habits, and (c) interact with habits in ways that preserve the learned habit associations. Finally, the authors outline the implications of the model for habit change, especially for the self-regulation of habit cuing.},

abstract = {Automation is the essence of MDD (Model-Driven Development). Transforming models into models following a set of rules is at the core of automation. It allows using tools to enliven processes that have been defined. Transition methods are most likely the most important player in the engineering of software. The 4SRS (Four Step Rule Set) is a transition method we adopt in this paper to focus the discussion on the transition from the analysis to the design of software. It has been formalized as a small software development process that can be plugged into larger software development processes. That formalization was conducted with the SPEM (Software {\&} Systems Process Engineering Metamodel), which is a process modeling language for the domain of software and systems. This paper exemplifies how a transition method like the 4SRS can be modeled with the SPEM as a way to study the benefits of the automatic or semiautomatic execution of a transition method as a small dedicated software development process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Tversky1973,
abstract = {This paper explores a judgmental heuristic in which a person evaluates the frequency of classes or the probability of events by availability, i.e., by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind. In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

This review examines the results, methods, measured behavioral and psychological outcomes, affordances in implemented persuasive systems, and domains of the studies in the current body of research on persuasive technologies. The reviewed studies have investigated diverse persuasive systems/designs, psychological factors, and behavioral outcomes. The results of the reviewed studies were categorized into fully positive, partially positive, and negative and/or no effects. This review provides an overview of the state of empirical research regarding persuasive technologies. The paper functions as a reference in positioning future research within the research stream of persuasive technologies in terms of the domain, the persuasive stimuli and the psychological and behavioral outcomes.},

abstract = {Phishers are fraudsters that mimic legitimate websites to steal user's credential information and exploit that information for identity theft and other criminal activities. Various anti-phishing techniques attempt to mitigate such attacks. Domain highlighting is one such approach recently incorporated by several popular web browsers. The idea is simple: the domain name of an address is highlighted in the address bar, so that users can inspect it to determine a web site's legitimacy. Our research asks a basic question: how well does domain highlighting work? To answer this, we showed 22 participants 16 web pages typical of those targeted for phishing attacks, where participants had to determine the page's legitimacy. In the first round, they judged the page's legitimacy by whatever means they chose. In the second round, they were directed specifically to look at the address bar. We found that participants fell into 3 types in terms of how they determined the legitimacy of a web page; while domain highlighting was somewhat effective for one user type, it was much less effective for others. We conclude that domain highlighting, while providing some benefit, cannot be relied upon as the sole method to prevent phishing attacks.},

abstract = {Given the widespread use of password authentication in on- line correspondence, subscription services, and shopping, there is growing concern about identity theft. When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

@article{Haque2014Hierarchy,
abstract = {In this study, we propose a hierarchy of password importance, and we use an experiment to examine the degree of similarity between passwords for lower-level (e.g. news portal) and higher-level (e.g. banking) websites in this hierarchy. We asked subjects to construct passwords for websites at both levels. Leveraging the lower-level passwords along with a dictionary attack, we successfully cracked almost one-third of the subjects' higher-level passwords. In a survey, subjects reported frequently reusing higher-level passwords, with or without modifications, as well as using a similar process to construct both levels of passwords. We thus conclude that unsafely shared or leaked lower-level passwords can be used by attackers to crack higher-level passwords. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Shropshire2006PersonalityITSec,
abstract = {Despite numerous advances in IT security, many computer users are still vulnerable to security-related risks because they do not comply with organizational policies and procedures. In a network setting, individual risk can extend to all networked users. Endpoint security refers to the set of organizational policies, procedures, and practices directed at securing the endpoint of the network connections – the individual end user. As such, the challenges facing IT managers in providing effective endpoint security are unique in that they often rely heavily on end user participation. But vulnerability can be minimized through modification of desktop security programs and increased vigilance on the part of the system administrator or CSO. The cost-prohibitive nature of these measures generally dictates targeting high-risk users on an individual basis. It is therefore important to differentiate between individuals who are most likely to pose a security risk and those who will likely follow most organizational policies and procedures. Keywords},

@inproceedings{Chiasson2006PasswordManagers,
abstract = {We present a usability study of two recent password manager proposals: PwdHash (Ross et al., 2005) and Password Multiplier (Halderman et al., 2005). Both papers considered usability issues in greater than typical detail, the former briefly reporting on a small usability study; both also provided implementations for download. Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

Therefore protecting its security is very important and becoming a top priority for many organizations. Unfortunately there is no single formula that can guarantee 100{\%} of information security. Therefore there is a need for a set of benchmarks or standards to ensure the best security practices are adopted and an adequate level of security is attained. In this paper, authors introduce various information security standards briefly and then provide a comparative study for major information security standards, namely ISO27001, BS 7799, PCIDSS, ITIL and COBIT.

Contrary to the assumption underlying the fundamental attribution error, the imputation of dispositional characteristics to individuals may be both logically and empirically tenable. Cogent address of the accuracy of attribution necessitates much greater progress toward establishing criteria of accuracy than has occurred to date. At present, evidence regarding a pronounced tendency to make attributions to situational factors may just as likely represent a fundamental error as it does a strong tendency to make attributions to dispositional characteristics. Also discussed are a distinction between error and bias and some of the indirect evidence that has been represented as showing the fundamental attribution error.

@article{Maruna2006,
abstract = {The notion of ‘cognitive distortion' has become enshrined in the offender treatment literature over the last 20 years, yet the concept still suffers from a lack of definitional clarity. In particular, the umbrella term is often used to refer to offence-supportive attitudes, cognitive processing during an offence sequence, as well as post-hoc neutralisations or excuses for offending. Of these very different processes, the last one might be the most popular and problematic. Treatment programmes for offenders often aim to eliminate excuse-making as a primary aim, and decision-makers place great weight on the degree to which an offender “takes responsibility” for his or her offending. Yet, the relationship between these after-the-fact explanations and future crime is not at all clear. Indeed, the designation of post hoc excuses as criminogenic may itself be an example of fallacious thinking. After all, outside of the criminal context, post hoc excuse-making is widely viewed as normal, healthy, and socially rewarded behaviour. We argue that the open exploration of contextual risk factors leading to offending can help in the identification of criminogenic factors as well as strengthen the therapeutic experience. Rather than insist that offenders take “responsibility” for the past, we suggest that efforts should focus on helping them take responsibility for the future, shifting the therapeutic focus from post hoc excuses to offence-supportive attitudes and underlying cognitive schemas that are empirically linked to re-offending.},

We found that testing high on the awareness sub-scale correlated with correctly identifying a phishing website; testing high on the passwords sub-scale correlated with creating passwords that could not be quickly cracked; testing high on the updating sub-scale correlated with applying software updates; and testing high on the se- curement sub-scale correlated with smartphone lock screen usage (e.g., PINs). Our results indicate that SeBIS predicts certain computer security behaviors and that it is a reliable and valid tool that should be used in future research.},

They were also asked whether they reveal their password(s) to friends and/or family and if they ever realized that their password was exposed or revealed to an attacker and the measures they took after that. Additionally, an extended literature review about password habits and effectiveness regarding length and complexity is included. At the end of the paper, for first time in Greece, there is a list of the 100 passwords that Greek users should absolutely avoid using due to the ease of guessing or weak complexity, short length or simply because they exist in every dictionary used for password attacks in the wild.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2015SecretsLies,
abstract = {We examine the ﬁrst large real-world data set on personal knowl- edge question's security and memorability from their deployment at Google. Our analysis conﬁrms that secret questions generally offer a security level that is far lower than user-chosen passwords. It turns out to be even lower than proxies such as the real distribution of sur- names in the population would indicate. Surprisingly, we found that a signiﬁcant cause of this insecurity is that users often don't answer truthfully. A user survey we conducted revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of users (37{\%}) who admitted to providing fake answers did so in an attempt to make them "harder to guess" although on aggregate this behavior had the opposite effect as people "harden" their answers in a predictable way. On the usability side, we show that secret answers have sur- prisingly poor memorability despite the assumption that reliability motivates their continued deployment. From millions of account re- covery attempts we observed a signiﬁcant fraction of users (e.g 40{\%} of our English-speaking US users) were unable to recall their an- swers when needed. This is lower than the success rate of alternative recovery mechanisms such as SMS reset codes (over 80{\%}). Comparing question strength and memorability reveals that the questions that are potentially the most secure (e.g what is your ﬁrst phone number) are also the ones with the worst memorability. We conclude that it appears next to impossible to ﬁnd secret questions that are both secure and memorable. Secret questions continue have some use when combined with other signals, but they should not be used alone and best practice should favor more reliable alternatives.},

@inproceedings{Mazurek2013Measuring,
abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

To gain this information an experiment has been developed which involves sending phishing email to users and collecting information about users. The detection deception model has been applied to identify users' detection behaviour. We find that users who have less email experience and high levels of submissiveness have increased susceptibility. Among those, users who have high susceptibility levels and high openness and extraversion are more likely to carry on the harmful action embedded in phishing emails.},

@inproceedings{Paiva2017Passfault,
abstract = {Most intelligent systems need a reliable authentication method in order to assure the security of sensitive information and devices, and vulnerable combinations of username and password make it easy for devices and accounts to be compromised by attackers. Big corporations have had their databases stolen, leaving millions of accounts compromised. Although many systems encourage users to select good passwords by enforcing policies, modern cracking techniques have proved such strategies to be insufficient. Along with easily guessable passwords, password reutilization is a common practice among average users, which might lead to a wide range of social engineering and privilege escalation techniques. An accurate evaluation of a password's resistance to being cracked has proved to be a critical challenge. This paper describes Passfault, which is an Open Source tool maintained by OWASP that poses as a promising method of making sure passwords will not be cracked. A solid mathematical foundation is presented, and Passfault's results over the famous password list RockYou are described. Then, the most popular password rules found in the list are used to simulate an attack against a recently leaked hash list, providing statistical insight about how corporations and users are managing their passwords},

This relationship held true across three types of procedures for producing normative focus (physiological arousal, modeling, and self-directed attention), across two types of settings (public and private), and across two types of norms (social and personal). Moreover, factors that would be expected to affect normative action were influential only when the norm was focal. These factors included the degree to which the action violated the relevant norm (Study 2) and the degree to which an individual subscribed to that norm (Study 3). Implications are discussed for developing campaigns to encourage prosocial behavior.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2010PasswordThicket,
abstract = {We report the results of the first large-scale empirical analysis of password implementations deployed on the Internet. Our study included 150 websites which offer free user accounts for a variety of purposes, including the most popular destinations on the web and a random sample of e-commerce, news, and communication websites. Although all sites evaluated relied on user-chosen textual passwords for authentication, we found many subtle but important technical variations in im- plementation with important security implications. Many poor practices were commonplace, such as a lack of encryption to protect transmitted passwords, storage of cleartext passwords in server databases, and little protection of passwords from brute force attacks. While a spectrum of imple- mentation quality exists with a general co-occurrence of more-secure and less-secure implementa- tion choices, we find a surprising number of inconsistent choices within individual sites, suggesting that the lack of a standards is harming security. We observe numerous ways in which the technical failures of lower-security sites can compromise higher-security sites due to the well-established ten- dency of users to re-use passwords. Our data confirms that the worst security practices are indeed found at sites with few security incentives, such as newspaper websites, while sites storing more sensitive information such as payment details or user communication implement more password se- curity. From an economic viewpoint, password insecurity is a negative externality that the market has been unable to correct, undermining the viability of password-based authentication. We also speculate that some sites deploying passwords do so primarily for psychological reasons, both as a justification for collecting marketing data and as a way to build trusted relationships with customers. This theory suggests that efforts to replace passwords with more-secure protocols or federated iden- tity systems may fail because they dont recreate the entrenched ritual of password authentication.},

The data showed which elements boost and which elements hurt perceptions of Web credibility. Through analysis we found these elements fell into one of seven factors. In order of impact, the five types of elements that increased credibility perceptions were “real-world feel,” “ease of use,” “expertise,” “trustworthiness,” and “tailoring.” The two types of elements that hurt credibility were “commercial implications” and “amateurism.” This large-scale study lays the groundwork for further research into the elements that affect Web credibility.

To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

abstract = {Designers are often faced with difficult tradeoffs between easing the user's burden by making security decisions for them and offering features that ensure that users can make the security decisions that are right for them and their environment. Users often do not understand enough about the impact of a security decision to make an informed choice. We report on the experience in a 500-person organization on the security of each user's Lotus Notes client against unsigned active content. We found that the default configuration of the majority of users did not allow unsigned active content to run. However, we found that when presented with a choice during their workflow, many of those otherwise secured users would allow unsigned active content to run. We discuss the features that are in Lotus Notes that provide security for active content and that respond to the usability issues from this study.},

@inproceedings{Miller2017UnderstandingEmojiAmbiguity,
abstract = {Recent studies have found that people interpret emoji charac-ters inconsistently, creating significant potential for miscom-munication. However, this research examined emoji in isola-tion, without consideration of any surrounding text. Prior work has hypothesized that examining emoji in their natural textual contexts would substantially reduce the observed po-tential for miscommunication. To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a controlled study with 2,482 participants who interpreted emoji both in isolation and in multiple textual contexts. After comparing the variability of emoji interpreta-tion in each condition, we found that our results do not sup-port the hypothesis in prior work: when emoji are interpreted in textual contexts, the potential for miscommunication ap-pears to be roughly the same. We also identify directions for future research to better understand the interplay between emoji and textual context.},

@inproceedings{Conklin2004PWAuthenticationSystemPerspective,
abstract = {User authentication in computer systems has been a cornerstone of computer security for decades. The concept of a user id and password is a cost effective and efficient method of maintaining a shared secret between a user and a computer system. One of the key elements in the password solution for security is a reliance on human cognitive ability to remember the shared secret. In early computing days with only a few computer systems and a small select group of users, this model proved effective. With the advent of the Internet, e-commerce, and the proliferation of PCs in offices and schools, the user base has grown both in number and in demographic base. Individual users no longer have single passwords for single systems, but are presented with the challenge of remembering numerous passwords for numerous systems, from email, to web accounts, to banking and financial services. This paper presents a conceptual model depicting how users and systems work together in this function and examines the consequences of the expanding user base and the use of password memory aids. A system model of the risks associated with password-based authentication is presented from a user centric point of view including the construct of user password memory aids. When confronted with too much data to remember, users develop memory aids to assist them in the task of remembering important pieces of information. These user password memory aids form a bridge between otherwise unconnected systems and have an effect on system level security across multiple systems interconnected by the user. A preliminary analysis of the implications of this user centric interconnection of security models is presented.},

@article{Arachchilage2013GameDesingPhishing,
abstract = {Game based education is becoming more and more popular. This is because game based education provides an opportunity for learning in a natural environment. Phishing is an online identity theft, which attempts to steal sensitive information such as username, password, and online banking details from its victims. To prevent this, phishing awareness needs to be considered. This research aims to develop a game design framework, which enhances user avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect users from phishing attacks. In order to do this, a theoretical model derived from Technology Thread Avoidance Theory (TTAT) was developed and used in the game design framework (Liang {\&} Xue, 2010). A survey study was undertaken with 150 regular computer users to elicit feedback through a questionnaire. The study findings revealed that perceived threat, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost, self-efficacy, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility elements should be addressed in the game design framework for computer users to avoid phishing attacks. Furthermore, we argue that this game design framework can be used not only for preventing phishing attacks but also for preventing other malicious IT attacks such as viruses, malware, botnets and spyware.{\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Brustoloni2007,
abstract = {Context-sensitive guidance (CSG) can help users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask the user to provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security dialogs irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic dialogs continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. Audited dialogs thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic dialogs. Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited dialogs. In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional dialogs. Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks.},

Passphrases, space-delimited sets of natural language words, have been sug- gested as both secure and usable for decades. In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3- and 4-word system- assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system- assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

@inproceedings{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp,
abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

@article{Proctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions,
abstract = {Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

Password managers offer some improvement without requiring server-side changes. In this paper, we evaluate the security of dual-possession authentication, an authentication approach offering encrypted storage of passwords and theft-resistance without the use of a master password. We further introduce Tapas, a concrete implementation of dual-possession authentication leveraging a desktop computer and a smartphone. Tapas requires no server-side changes to websites, no master password, and protects all the stored passwords in the event either the primary or secondary device (e.g., computer or phone) is stolen. To evaluate the viability of Tapas as an alternative to traditional password managers, we perform a 30 participant user study comparing Tapas to two configurations of Firefox's built-in password manager. We found users significantly preferred Tapas. We then improve Tapas by incorporating feedback from this study, and reevaluate it with an additional 10 participants. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

They provide sound arguments that certain social cognitive biases are in fact designed and functional, resulting in better solutions to adaptive problems than cognitive mechanisms that "accurately" detected social signals. They call for an evolutionary reformulation of the entire "heuristics and biases" literature, which typically cast humans as making illogical and unfounded errors. This new line of work has already led to the discovery of new cognitive biases and offers much promise for the future discovery of additional adaptive biases. It also may lead to the detumescence of decades of work that has cast humans erroneously as fundamentally irrational and hopelessly muddled in their judgment and decision making.

Self-awareness influenced older but not younger children. Naturally occurring standards instituted by the behavior of the first child to approach the candy bowl in each group were shown to interact with the experimenter's verbally stated standard. The behavior of 349 subjects in the second study replicated the findings in the first study. Additionally, when no standard was stated by the experimenter, children took more candy when not self-aware than when self-aware.},

Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

abstract = {Challenging the conventional wisdom that users cannot remember cryptographically-strong secrets, we test the hypothesis that users can learn randomly-assigned 56- bit codes (encoded as either 6 words or 12 characters) through spaced repetition. We asked remote research participants to perform a distractor task that required log- ging into a website 90 times, over up to two weeks, with a password of their choosing. After they entered their chosen password correctly we displayed a short code (4 letters or 2 words, 18.8 bits) that we required them to type. For subsequent logins we added an increasing de- lay prior to displaying the code, which participants could avoid by typing the code from memory. As participants learned, we added two more codes to comprise a 56.4- bit secret. Overall, 94{\%} of participants eventually typed their entire secret from memory, learning it after a me- dian of 36 logins. The learning component of our system added a median delay of just 6.9 s per login and a to- tal of less than 12 minutes over an average of ten days. 88{\%} were able to recall their codes exactly when asked at least three days later, with only 21{\%} reporting having written their secret down. As one participant wrote with surprise, “the words are branded into my brain.” While our study is preliminary in nature, we believe it debunks the myth that users are inherently incapable of remem- bering cryptographically-strong secrets for a select few high-stakes scenarios, such as a password for enterprise login or as a master key to protect other credentials (e.g., in a password manager).},

@inproceedings{Inglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies,
abstract = {HCI research published 10 years ago pointed out that many users cannot cope with the number and complexity of passwords, and resort to insecure workarounds as a consequence. We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

@inproceedings{Kang2015MentalModelsDrawing,
abstract = {Many people use the Internet every day yet know little about how it really works. Prior literature diverges on how people's Internet knowledge affects their privacy and security decisions. We undertook a qualitative study to understand what people do and do not know about the Internet and how that knowledge affects their responses to privacy and security risks. Lay people, as compared to those with computer science or related backgrounds, had simpler mental models that omitted Internet levels, organizations, and entities. People with more articulated technical models perceived more privacy threats, possibly driven by their more accurate understanding of where specific risks could occur in the network. Despite these differences, we did not find a direct relationship between people's technical background and the actions they took to control their privacy or increase their security online. Consistent with other work on user knowledge and experience, our study suggests a greater emphasis on policies and systems that protect privacy and security without relying too much},
address = {Ottawa, Canada},
annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- try to find out user's mental models about
the internet and privacy issues
- privacy paradox / what hampers actions?

2. How did they do it?
- qualitative study with drawing tasks
- 28 participants, video recording
- coding of dimensions in which drawings differed
- divided into laymen, techical people, and sampled
from the community (older)

3. What was their goal?
- understand misconceptions about entities on the web
- understand how users perceive attack vectors

4. What are the results?
- strong differences depending on the educational background
- no IT background: simple, service oriented mental models,
- technical background: multi-layer environment with
entities and organizations.
- most often, people get more privacy sensitive by experiencing breaches or harmful activity. 
- technical background does not lead to more actions taken

5. What could be improved?
- sample size with 28
- sample population is mostly students / university staff
- show all drawings
- conceptualize the mental models better (not just tables)},

@article{Grady1998NeuralCorrelates,
abstract = {A striking characteristic of human memory is that pictures are remembered better than words. We examined the neural correlates of memory for pictures and words in the context of episodic memory encoding to determine material-specific differences in brain activity patterns. To do this, we used positron emission tomography to map the brain regions active during encoding of words and pictures of objects. Encoding was carried out by using three different strategies to explore possible interactions between material specificity and types of processing. Encoding of pictures resulted in greater activity of bilateral visual and medial temporal cortices, compared with encoding words, whereas encoding of words was associated with increased activity in prefrontal and temporoparietal regions related to language function. Each encoding strategy was characterized by a distinctive activity pattern, but these patterns were largely the same for pictures and words. Thus, superior overall memory for pictures may be mediated by more effective and automatic engagement of areas important for visual memory, including medial temporal cortex, whereas the mechanisms underlying specific encoding strategies appear to operate similarly on pictures and words.},

Forty-five males and 27 females, differing in extraversion and neuroticism, rated the frequency with which they use each of 12 main Internet services. An exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors of Internet services: social services; information services; and leisure services. Extraversion and neuroticism showed different patterns of relationships with the factors of the Internet-Services Scale, with different patterns of association for men and women. For men, extraversion was positively related to the use of leisure services and neuroticism was negatively related to information services, whereas for women, extraversion was negatively related and neuroticism positively related to the use of social services. Implications for the study of the psychological influences of the Internet are discussed.},

In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3- and 4-word system- assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system- assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

abstract = {We present the results of an experiment examining the extent to which individuals will tolerate delays when told that such delays are for security purposes. In our experiment, we asked 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk users to count the total number of times a certain term was repeated in a multi-page document. The task was designed to be conducive to cheating. We assigned subjects to four between-subjects conditions: one of these offered a concrete security reason (virus-scanning) for the delay, another offered only a vague security explanation, another did not mention security at all, and a control condition without a delay. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to cheat or abandon the task when provided no explanation or a vague security explanation for the delay. However, when subjects were provided more explanation about the threat model and the protection ensured by the delay, they were not more likely to cheat than subjects in the control condition who faced no such delay. Our results thus contribute to the nascent literature on soft paternalistic solutions to security and privacy problems by suggesting that, when security mitigations cannot be made “free” for users, designers may incentivize compliant users' behavior by intentionally drawing attention to the mitigation itself.},

However, people need to share the same understanding of what each emoji symbolises, otherwise communication can breakdown. We surveyed 436 people about their use of emoji and ran an interactive study using a two-dimensional emotion space to investigate (1) the variation in people's interpretation of emoji and (2) their interpretation of corre- sponding Android and iOS emoji. Our results show vari- ations between people's ratings within and across plat- forms. We outline our solution to reduce misunderstand- ings that arise from different interpretations of emoji.},

abstract = {Investigations of computer user behavior become especially important when behaviors like security software adoption affect organizational information resource security, but adoption antecedents remain elusive. Technology adoption studies typically predict behavioral outcomes by investigating the relationship between attitudes and intentions, though intention may not be the best predictor of actual behavior. Personality constructs have recently been found to explain even more variance in behavior, thus providing insights into user behavior. This research incorporates conscientiousness and agreeableness into a conceptual model of security software use. Attitudinal constructs perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were linked with behavioral intent, while the relationship between intent and actual use was found to be moderated by conscientiousness and agreeableness. The results that the moderating effect of personality greatly increases the amount of variance explained in actual use.},

There currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has increased. In this paper we release emoji2vec, pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emoji which are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing applications alongside word2vec. We demonstrate, for the downstream task of sentiment analysis, that emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in which emoji need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation.},

@article{DeAngeli2005PictureThousandWords,
abstract = {The weakness of knowledge-based authentication systems, such as passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), is well known, and reflects an uneasy compromise between security and human memory constraints. Research has been undertaken for some years now into the feasibility of graphical authentication mechanisms in the hope that these will provide a more secure and memorable alternative. The graphical approach substitutes the exact recall of alphanumeric codes with the recognition of previously learnt pictures, a skill at which humans are remarkably proficient. So far, little attention has been devoted to usability, and initial research has failed to conclusively establish significant memory improvement. This paper reports two user studies comparing several implementations of the graphical approach with PINs. Results demonstrate that pictures can be a solution to some problems relating to traditional knowledge-based authentication but that they are not a simple panacea, since a poor design can eliminate the picture superiority effect in memory. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of the graphical approach and providing guidelines for developers contemplating using these mechanisms. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Proper names and birthdays are the primary information used in constructing passwords, accounting for about half of all password constructions. Almost all respondents reuse passwords, and about two thirds of password uses are duplications. Passwords have been forgotten by a third of respondents, and over half keep a written record of them.

We tested the availability of a large corpus of over 100,000 possible phrases at Amazons registration page, which prohibits using any phrase already registered by another user. A number of large, readily-available lists such as movie and book titles prove effective in guessing attacks, suggesting that passphrases are vulnerable to dictionary attacks like all schemes involving human choice. Extending our analysis with natural language phrases extracted from linguistic corpora, we find that phrase selection is far from random, with users strongly preferring simple noun bigrams which are common in natural language. The distribution of cho- sen passphrases is less skewed than the distribution of bigrams in English text, indicating that some users have attempted to choose phrases ran- domly. Still, the distribution of bigrams in natural language is not nearly random enough to resist offline guessing, nor are longer three- or four- word phrases for which we see rapidly diminishing returns.},

To help individuals avoid such regrets, we designed two modi- fications to the Facebook web interface that nudge users to consider the content and audience of their online disclosures more carefully. We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants' interactions with the nudges, the con- tent of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; how- ever, introducing a time delay before publishing users' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying. On bal- ance, some participants found the nudges helpful while oth- ers found them unnecessary or overly intrusive. We discuss implications and challenges for designing and evaluating sys- tems to assist users with online disclosures.},

Results indicate that the mirror does manipulate, and the private subscale of the SCS does measure, self-attention. Exp II, with 81 female undergraduates, was a replication of the 1st study, but using an audience instead of a mirror. Results indicate that audience presence also heightens self-attention.

While categories limit the number of emoji in each individual list, the overall number is still so large, that emoji entry is a challenging task. The task takes particularly long if users pick the wrong category when searching for an emoji. Instead, we propose a new zooming keyboard for emoji entry.

We compare our zooming emoji keyboard against the Google keyboard and find that our keyboard allows for 18{\%} faster emoji entry, reducing the required time for one emoji from 15.6s to 12.7s.

Consistent with the hypotheses, the results indicate that (1) brands tend to gain share when they become compromise alternatives in a choice set; (2) attrac- tion and compromise effects tend to b{\textgreater}e stronger among subjects v/ho expect to justify their decisions to others; and (3) selections of dominating and compromise brands are associated with more elaborate and difficult decisions.},

abstract = {People see themselves as less susceptible to bias than others. We show that a source of this bias blind spot involves the value that people place, and believe they should place, on introspective information (relative to behavioral information) when assessing bias in themselves versus others. Participants considered introspective information more than behavioral information for assessing bias in themselves, but not others. This divergence did not arise simply from differences in introspective access. The blind spot persisted when observers had access to the introspections of the actor whose bias they judged. And, participants claimed that they, but not their peers, should rely on introspections when making self-assessments of bias. Only after being educated about the importance of nonconscious processes in guiding judgment and action-and thereby about the fallibility of introspection-did participants cease denying their relative susceptibility to bias. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Bellur2014,
abstract = {Communication research based on social cognition draws heavily from dual process models such as the heuristic-systematic model. Both heuristic and systematic processing are said to be aided by quick rules of thumb or mental shortcuts called heuristics. However, the operationalization of heuristics is quite problematic because their use in decision-making is not directly measured. Scholars claim the operation of specific heuristics in specific situations, based often on clever experimental evidence. We propose a methodological framework that calls for both manipulation and measurement of heuristics in order to offer more direct evidence of their operation. We first review different existing approaches in the literature for operationalizing heuristics. We then discuss our approach and describe the application of moderated mediation to analyze the resulting data. We conclude with a study idea and simulated data that illustrate how our proposed design and analysis framework could be applied in communication research.},

abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks as well as affect user behavior on social networks. This study examines the correlation between the Big Five personality traits and email phishing response. Another aspect examined is how these factors relate to users' tendency to share information and protect their privacy on Facebook (which is one of the most popular social networking sites). This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users. The goal of this study is to better understand the traits that contribute to online vulnerability, for the purpose of developing customized user interfaces and secure awareness education, designed to increase users' privacy and security in the future.},

abstract = {Passwords remain the dominant authentication mechanism for information security. Unfortunately, research has shown that most passwords are highly insecure. Given the risks of using weak passwords, there is a need to effectively motivate users to select strong passwords. In this study we examine the influence of interactivity, as well as static and interactive fear appeals, on motivating users to increase the strength of their passwords. We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries. We found that while the interactive password strength meter and static fear appeal treatments were not effective, the interactive fear appeal treatment resulted in significantly stronger passwords. Our findings suggest that interactive fear appeals are a promising means of encouraging a range of secure behaviors in end users.},

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated.

On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

The studies consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo effect.

abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

@article{Renaud2009VisualSnakeOil,
abstract = {Users of computer systems are accustomed to being asked for passwords -- it is as universal as it is frustrating. In the past there was little tolerance for the problems experienced remembering passwords, and many users still remember, with embarrassment, having to go hat-in-hand to request a password change and being treated with disdain by a lofty administrator. Latterly there is more understanding of the problems experienced by users, especially since the "password conundrum" has reached epidemic proportions for Web users, who are asked for passwords with unrelenting predictability. The problems with passwords are clear -- users cannot remember numbers of meaningless alphanumeric strings with ease. Hence, they react by choosing simple and predictable words or numbers related to their everyday life, and engaging in insecure practices, such as writing passwords down or sharing them. These practices cause a breach affecting even the most secure and protected network system. Hence the user is often called the weakest link of the security chain, with system administrators despairing of trying to maintain security with the weak link so often reaching breaking point. Users forgetting passwords has serious economical consequences for organizations. Both academia and industry have been investigating alternatives to passwords, with varying degrees of success. One of the most well-known solutions is the biometric -- measurement of either behavioral or physiological characteristics of the end-user. This is obviously superior to the password because it removes the burden on the user's memory. So why don't we just switch to biometrics and give the poor user a break? There are some valid and hard-to-overcome reasons for the slow uptake of biometrics, but before we can discuss them we need to consider the mechanics of authentication.},

@article{Fagan2017UsersConsiderationsPWMs,
abstract = {Password managers, though commonly recommended by security experts, are still not used by many users. Understanding why some choose to use password managers while others do not is important towards generally understanding why some users do what they do and, by extension, designing motivational tools such as video tutorials to help motivate more to use password managers. To investigate differences between those who do and do not use a password manager, for this paper, we distributed an online survey to a total of 137 users and 111 non-users of the tool that asked about their opinions/experiences with password managers. Furthermore, since emotion has been identified by work in psychology and communications as influential in other risk- laden decision-making (e.g., safe-sex behavior such as condom use), we asked partici- pants who use a password manager to rate how they feel for 45 different emotions, or, as the case for those who do not use a password manager, to rate how they imagine they would feel the 45 emotions if they did use the tool. Our results show that “users” of password managers noted convenience and usefulness as the main reasons behind using the tool, rather than security gains, underscoring the fact that even a large por- tion of users of the tool are not considering security as the primary benefit while mak- ing the decision. On the other hand, “non-users” noted security concerns as the main reason for not using a password manager, highlighting the prevalence of suspicion arising from lack of understanding of the technology itself. Finally, analysis of the differ- ences in emotions between “users” and “non-users” reveals that participants who never use a password manager are more likely to feel suspicious compared to “users,” which could be due to misunderstandings about the tool.},

@article{McCrae1987,
abstract = {Test scores of divergent thinking obtained between 1959 and 1972 were correlated with a variety of personality measures administered since 1980. In this sample of 268 men, divergent thinking was consistently associated with self-reports and ratings of openness to experience, but not with neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, or conscientiousness. Both divergent thinking and openness were also modestly correlated with Gough's (1979) empirically derived Creative Personality Scale. Several other personality variables mentioned in the literature were also examined; those that were associated with divergent thinking were also generally correlated with openness. These data suggest that creativity is particularly related to the personality domain of openness to experience. Although some object that the distinction is artificial (Heim, 1970), cognition and personality have traditionally been seen as distinct domains. Intelligence is construed as a set of aptitudes and abilities; personality is viewed, at least by psychometricians, as a collection of characteristic dispositions. Empirically, there is some justification for the separation. Measures of personality traits typically show very modest correlations with tests of general intelligence (e.g., Eysenck {\&} Eysenck, 1975), and joint factor analyses of personality and cognitive ability variables show that the latter form a distinct factor (McCrae {\&} Costa, 1985b, 1985c). Creativity, however, seems to hold an intermediate position. The novelty and originality of creative productions imply both an ability to think fluently and flexibly and an inclination to do so. A voluminous literature has documented the importance of both these aspects of creativity (Barron {\&} Harrington, 1981). In this article, I attempt to organize the findings on personality characteristics associated with creativity by reference to a well-established taxonomy of personality traits. Specifically, I am testing the hypothesis that creativity is uniquely associated with the personality domain of openness to experience. Creativity, TS  - RIS},

The latest Global Phishing Survey, published by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), has new data that shows where phishing has been taking place, and in some cases how and why. The report indicates that, through the later part of 2009, a single gang of phishers - the 'Avalanche' operation - was responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks launched on the Internet. Greg Aaron, a director at Afilias, analyses the activities of the Avalanche group and asks what they tell us about the state of phishing today. Famous old-time bank robber Willie Sutton said, "Go where the money is ... and go there often".

Passwords remain the most common form of authentication but continue to face various practical challenges, not least of which is getting users to make appropriate choices in the first place. Steven Furnell and Rawan Esmael of the University of Plymouth conducted a series of experiments to assess users' password creation behaviour with varying levels of support, ranging from unguided to feedback approaches using emoji-based indicators.

abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

@article{Jenkins2014a,
abstract = {Password reuse-using the same password for multiple accounts-is a prevalent phenomenon that can make even the most secure systems vulnerable. When passwords are reused across multiple systems, hackers may compromise accounts by stealing passwords from low-security sites to access sites with higher security. Password reuse can be particularly threatening to users in developing countries in which cyber-security training is limited, law enforcement of cyber-security is non-existent, or in which programs to secure cyberspace are limited. This article proposes a two-pronged solution for reducing password reuse through detection and mitigation. First, based on the theories of routine, cognitive load, and motor movement, we hypothesize that password reuse can be detected by monitoring characteristics of users' typing behavior (i.e., keystroke dynamics). Second, based on protection motivation theory, we hypothesize that providing just-in-time fear appeals when a violation is detected will decrease password reuse. We tested our hypotheses in an experiment and found that users' keystroke dynamics are diagnostic of password reuse. By analyzing changes in typing patterns, we were able to detect password reuse with 81.71{\%} accuracy. We also found that just-in-time fear appeals decrease password reuse; 88.41{\%} of users who received a fear appeal subsequently created unique passwords, whereas only 4.45{\%} of users who did not receive a fear appeal created unique passwords. Our results suggest that future research should continue to examine keystroke dynamics as an indicator of cyber-security behaviors, and use just-in-time fear appeals as a method for reducing non-secure behavior. The findings of our research provide a practical and cost-effective solution to bolster cyber-security through discouraging password reuse.

The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

Our system relies on the human ability to recognize a degraded version of a previously seen image. We illustrate how distorted images can be used to maintain the usability of graphical password schemes while making them more resilient to social engineering or observation attacks. Because it is difficult to mentally “revert” a degraded image, without knowledge of the original image, our scheme provides a strong line of defense against impostor access, while preserving the desirable memorability properties of graphical password schemes. Using low-fidelity tests to aid in the design, we implement prototypes of Use Your Illusion as i) an Ajax-based web service and ii) on Nokia N70 cellular phones. We conduct a between-subjects usability study of the cellular phone prototype with a total of 99 participants in two experiments. We demonstrate that, regardless of their age or gender, users are very skilled at recognizing degraded versions of self-chosen images, even on small displays and after time periods of one month. Our results indicate that graphical passwords with distorted images can achieve equivalent error rates to those using traditional images, but only when the original image is known.},

In this paper, we challenge the long-standing assumption that only one authen- tication scheme can be offered by an application service. We pro- pose Choose Your Own Authentication (CYOA); a novel authenti- cation architecture that enables users to choose a scheme amongst several available alternatives. CYOA would enable users to select whichever scheme best suits their preferences, abilities, and usage context. Existing text password systems could easily be replaced. Furthermore, the three-party architecture would enable delegating the management of authentication systems to trusted-third parties. The architecture allows rapid deployment and testing of novel au- thentication technologies. Our two-week usability study suggests that participants were willing to leverage alternative schemes.

annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- the authors propose a system that lets the users choose their own authentication scheme.
- available schemes: Persuasive Text Passwords, Persuasive Cued Click Points, object passtiles, text passwords (baseline)

2. How did they do it?
- they conducted a small, 2 week user study with 39 participants who were prompted to log in to web sites from the MVP web-auth framework (see [5]). 

3. What was their goal?
- find evidence for/against hypotheses: h1: user do not prefer one over the other; h2: the users first take the time to learn sth about the available schemes; h3: users like CYOA

4. What are the results?
- surprise surprise: all hypotheses were confirmed. 
- users avoided Persuasive Text Password for their second account. 
- no preference of text passwords
- when people tried out a novel scheme, they switched back to text passwords and vice versa.
- users who spend more time reading the intro, were more likely to use novel schemes.
- users don't base their choice on security concerns.
- users did not switch their chosen scheme when resetting.

5. What could be improved?
- the conclusions are clearly flawed.
- the participants simply were open-minded study participants who also would behave differently in real life. 
- the statistics are traditional hypothesis tests that cannot be taken too seriously with this N
- within two weeks for artificial, uninteresting accounts it's no surprise that users did not reset their passwords / schemes. 
- the chosen schemes were all published by the authors and no one else likes them. authors were clearly biased in favor of them. 

Ah. The idea is great, but I really hate how they put it into practice and what they claim with their study. They could have done better.

abstract = {Mobile devices contain a multitude of sensitive data and provide access to even more data as well as services somewhere on the Internet. Even if only temporarily in the hands of non-entitled persons, privacy is at stake. Authentication protects against unauthorized usage. Today's operating systems of mobile devices offer authentication mechanisms. However, they are either vulnerable in some situations or not user friendly enough to be widely adopted. In this paper we suggest a novel authentication system which meets both the requirements of security and usability. For that purpose, we have analyzed existing authentication methods as well as targeting attacks. The resulting Android application SecureLock is a generic authentication system, which offers PIN and password, but also a property-based authentication method by means of NFC tags, and a novel image-based method called GesturePuzzle. The application has been evaluated and compared with other approaches for security and usability.},

@incollection{Haselton,
abstract = {In this chapter, Martie Haselton, Daniel Nettle, and Paul Andrews present theory and empirical research on the evolution of cognitive biases in social interaction. They provide sound arguments that certain social cognitive biases are in fact designed and functional, resulting in better solutions to adaptive problems than cognitive mechanisms that "accurately" detected social signals. They call for an evolutionary reformulation of the entire "heuristics and biases" literature, which typically cast humans as making illogical and unfounded errors. This new line of work has already led to the discovery of new cognitive biases and offers much promise for the future discovery of additional adaptive biases. It also may lead to the detumescence of decades of work that has cast humans erroneously as fundamentally irrational and hopelessly muddled in their judgment and decision making. },

abstract = {With an increasing number of organizations allowing per- sonal smart phones onto their networks, considerable secu- rity risk is introduced. The security risk is exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices and their respective installed pool of applications. Further- more, by virtue of the devices not being owned by the orga- nization, the ability to authoritatively enforce organizational security polices is challenging. As a result, a critical part of organizational security is the ability to drive user security behavior through either on-device mechanisms or security awareness programs. In this paper, we establish a base- line for user security behavior from a population of over one hundred fifty smart phone users. We then systematically evaluate the ability to drive behavioral change via messag- ing centered on morality, deterrence, and incentives. Our findings suggest that appeals to morality are most effective over time, whereas deterrence produces the most immediate reaction. Additionally, our findings show that while a sig- nificant portion of users are securing their devices without prior intervention, it is difficult to influence change in those who do not.},

This attack method, commonly known as “phishing,” is most commonly initiated by sending out emails with links to spoofed websites that harvest information. We present a method for detecting these attacks, which in its most gen- eral form is an application of machine learning on a fea- ture set designed to highlight user-targeted deception in electronic communication. This method is applicable, with slight modification, to detection of phishing websites, or the emails used to direct victims to these sites. We evaluate this method on a set of approximately 860 such phishing emails, and 6950 non-phishing emails, and correctly identify over 96{\%} of the phishing emails while only mis-classifying on the order of 0.1{\%} of the legitimate emails. We conclude with thoughts on the future for such techniques to specifi- cally identify deception, specifically with respect to the evo- lutionary nature of the attacks and information available.},

abstract = {Statistics are tools to help end users (here, researchers) accomplish their task (advance scientific knowledge). Science is a collective and cumulative enterprise, so to be qualified as usable, statistical tools should support and promote clear thinking as well as clear and truthful communication. Yet areas such as human-computer interaction (HCI) have adopted tools – i.e., p-values and statistical significance testing – that have proven to be quite poor at supporting these tasks. The use and misuse of p-values and significance testing has been severely criticized in a range of disciplines for several decades, suggesting that tools should be blamed, not end users. This article explains why it would be beneficial for HCI to switch from statis- tical significance testing to estimation, i.e., reporting informative charts with effect sizes and confidence intervals, and offering nuanced interpretations of our results. Advice is offered on how to communicate our empirical results in a clear, accurate, and transparent way without using any p-value. Key-words:},

@inproceedings{Florencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom,
abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

Information campaigns emphasize that alco- hol and drug use is intolerably high, that adolescent suicide rates are alarming, and—most relevant to this article—that ram- pant polluters are spoiling the environment. Although these claims may be both true and well intentioned, the campaigns' cre- ators have missed something critically important: Within the statement “Many people are doing this undesirable thing” lurks the powerful and under- cutting normative message “Many people are doing this.” Only by aligning descriptive norms (what people typically do) with injunctive norms (what people typically approve or disapprove) can one optimize the power of normative ap- peals. Communicators who fail to recognize the distinction be- tween these two types of norms imperil their persuasive efforts. Keywords},

We controlled for trustworthiness and amount of information each website requested, as well as the con- sent dialog layout. We discovered that these factors had no observable effects, likely because participants did not read the dialogs. Yet, 15{\%} still refused to use Facebook Connect, citing privacy concerns. A likely explanation for subjects ignoring the dialogs while also understand- ing the privacy tradeoff—our exit survey indicated that 88{\%} broadly understood what data would be collected— is that subjects were already familiar with the dialogs prior to the experiment. We discuss how our results demonstrate informed consent, but also how habitua- tion prevented subjects from understanding the nuances between individual websites' data collection policies.},

@inproceedings{Herley2009SoLongThanksExternalities,
abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100{\%} of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01{\%} of them a modest annual pain.},

This review examines the results, methods, measured behavioral and psychological outcomes, affordances in implemented persuasive systems, and domains of the studies in the current body of research on persuasive technologies. The reviewed studies have investigated diverse persuasive systems/designs, psychological factors, and behavioral outcomes. The results of the reviewed studies were categorized into fully positive, partially positive, and negative and/or no effects. This review provides an overview of the state of empirical research regarding persuasive technologies. The paper functions as a reference in positioning future research within the research stream of persuasive technologies in terms of the domain, the persuasive stimuli and the psychological and behavioral outcomes.},

The model enables a more objective and high-level assessment of the design of such systems; it has also been used to sketch a possible new scheme, AutoPass, intended to incorporate the best features of the prior art whilst also addressing many of the most serious shortcomings of existing systems through the inclusion of novel features.},

Sadly, they often result in users' passwords exhibiting new, yet still predictable, patterns. In this paper, we investigate the usability and security of adaptive password-composition policies, which dynamically change password requirements over time as users create new passwords. We conduct a 2,619- participant between-subjects online experiment to evaluate the strength and usability of passwords created with two adaptive password policies. We also design and test a feedback system that guides users to successfully create a password conforming to these policies. We find that a wellconfigured, structure-based adaptive password policy can significantly increase password strength with little to no decrease in usability. We discuss how system administrators can use these results to improve password diversity.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

Self-awareness influenced older but not younger children. Naturally occurring standards instituted by the behavior of the first child to approach the candy bowl in each group were shown to interact with the experimenter's verbally stated standard. The behavior of 349 subjects in the second study replicated the findings in the first study. Additionally, when no standard was stated by the experimenter, children took more candy when not self-aware than when self-aware.},

Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

abstract = {The present model outlines the mechanisms underlying habitual control of responding and the ways in which habits interface with goals. Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between responses and the features of performance contexts that have historically covaried with them (e.g., physical settings, preceding actions). Once a habit is formed, perception of contexts triggers the associated response without a mediating goal. Nonetheless, habits interface with goals. Constraining this interface, habit associations accrue slowly and do not shift appreciably with current goal states or infrequent counterhabitual responses. Given these constraints, goals can (a) direct habits by motivating repetition that leads to habit formation and by promoting exposure to cues that trigger habits, (b) be inferred from habits, and (c) interact with habits in ways that preserve the learned habit associations. Finally, the authors outline the implications of the model for habit change, especially for the self-regulation of habit cuing.},

Behavioral economics has produced theories to explain when and why people make such allegedly irrational decisions, for example if it comes to spending money. However, humans tend to use reference points to judge and decide. Nowadays, mobile devices can work as flexible tools to create reference points thus supporting decisions without being explicit about it. We discuss if and how mobile apps can influence decision making. As a consequence, apps can be built to better fit into the decision making progress. We argue that applying concepts from behavioral economics can increase user experience in a subtle manner.},

Famed hacker Kevin Mitnick revealed that he hardly ever cracked a password, because it “was easier to dupe people into revealing it” by employing a range of social engineering techniques. Often, such failures are attributed to users' carelessness and ignorance. However, more enlightened researchers have pointed out that current security tools are simply too complex for many users, and they have made efforts to improve user interfaces to security tools. In this chapter, we aim to broaden the current perspective, focusing on the usability of security tools (or products) and the process of designing secure systems for the real-world context (the panorama) in which they have to operate. Here we demonstrate how current human factors knowledge and user-centered design principles can help security designers produce security solutions that are effective in practice.},

@article{Gilbert1995CorrespondenceBias,
abstract = {The correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person's unique and enduring dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the situations in which they occur. Although this tendency is one of the most fundamental phenomena in social psychology, its causes and consequences remain poorly understood. This article sketches an intellectual history of the correspondence bias as an evolving problem in social psychology, describes 4 mechanisms (lack of awareness, unrealistic expectations, inflated categorizations, and incomplete corrections) that produce distinct forms of correspondence bias, and discusses how the consequences of correspon-dence-biased inferences may perpetuate such inferences. One will seldom go wrong if one attributes extreme actions to van-ity, average ones to habit, and petty ones to fear. (Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886/1984, p. 59) Despite the homilies of philosophers, no one has yet found a simple formula for understanding others. The problem, of course, is that a person's inner self is hidden from view. Charac-ter, motive, belief, desire, and intention play leading roles in people's construal of others, and yet none of these constructs can actually be observed. As such, people are forced into the difficult business of inferring these intangibles from that which is, in fact, observable: other people's words and deeds. When one infers the invisible from the visible, one risks making a mis-take. Three decades of research in social psychology have shown that many of the mistakes people make are of a kind: When people observe behavior, they often conclude that the person who performed the behavior was predisposed to do so—that the person's behavior corresponds to the person's unique disposi-tions—and they draw such conclusions even when a logical analysis suggests they should not. In this article, we describe the causes and consequences of this particular mistake, which we call the correspondence bias. We do not attempt a complete review of the voluminous litera-ture on this topic. Rather, we first define the correspondence},

We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

We designed a new SSL warning based on recommendations from warning literature and tested our proposal with microsurveys and a field experiment. We ultimately failed at our goal of a well-understood warning. However, nearly 30{\%} more total users chose to remain safe after seeing our warning. We attribute this success to opinionated design, which promotes safety with visual cues. Subsequently, our proposal was released as the new Google Chrome SSL warning. We raise questions about warning comprehension advice and recommend that other warning designers use opinionated design.},

Results indicate that the mirror does manipulate, and the private subscale of the SCS does measure, self-attention. Exp II, with 81 female undergraduates, was a replication of the 1st study, but using an audience instead of a mirror. Results indicate that audience presence also heightens self-attention.

In response to this threat, password composition policies have grown increasingly complex. However, there is insufficient research defining metrics to characterize password strength and using them to evaluate password-composition policies. In this paper, we analyze 12,000 passwords collected under seven composition policies via an online study. We develop an efficient distributed method for calculating how effectively several heuristic password-guessing algorithms guess passwords. Leveraging this method, we investigate (a) the resistance of passwords created under different conditions to guessing, (b) the performance of guessing algorithms under different training sets, (c) the relationship between passwords explicitly created under a given composition policy and other passwords that happen to meet the same requirements, and (d) the relationship between guess ability, as measured with password-cracking algorithms, and entropy estimates. Our findings advance understanding of both password-composition policies and metrics for quantifying password security.},

abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

@inproceedings{Fahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy,
abstract = {The ecological validity of password studies is a complex topic and difficult to quantify. Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2012ReplacePasswords,
abstract = {We evaluate two decades of proposals to replace text passwords for general-purpose user authentication on the web using a broad set of twenty-five usability, deployability and security benefits that an ideal scheme might provide. The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

@article{Halevi2015SpearPhishing,
abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks. In this study a real-world spear-phishing attack was performed on employees in organizational settings in order to examine how users' personality, attitudinal and perceived efficacy factors affect their tendency to expose themselves to such an attack. Spear-phishing attacks are more sophisticated than regular phishing attacks as they use personal information about their intended victim and present a stronger challenge for detection by both the potential victims as well as email phishing filters.While previous research showed that certain phishing attacks can lure a higher response rate from people with a higher level of the personality trait of Neuroticism, other traits were not explored in this context. The present study included a field-experiment which revealed a number of factors that increase the likelihood of users falling for a phishing attack: the factor that was found to be most correlated to the phishing response was users' Conscientiousness personality trait. The study also found gender-based difference in the response, with women more likely to respond to a spear-phishing message than men. In addition, this work detected negative correlation between the participants subjective estimate of their own vulnerability to phishing attacks and the likelihood that they will be phished. Put together, the finding suggests that vulnerability to phishing is in part a function of users' personality and that vulnerability is not due to lack of awareness of phishing risks. This implies that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by the users themselves, and that a targeted approach to defense may increase security effectiveness.},

@inproceedings{Wiedenbeck2006ConvexHull,
abstract = {When users input their passwords in a public place, they may be at risk of attackers stealing their password. An attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the individual's authentication session. This is referred to as shoulder-surfing and is a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. Until recently, the only defense against shoulder-surfing has been vigilance on the part of the user. This paper reports on the design and evaluation of a game-like graphical method of authentication that is resistant to shoulder-surfing. The Convex Hull Click (CHC) scheme allows a user to prove knowledge of the graphical password safely in an insecure location because users never have to click directly on their password images. Usability testing of the CHC scheme showed that novice users were able to enter their graphical password accurately and to remember it over time. However, the protection against shoulder-surfing comes at the price of longer time to carry out the authentication.},

@article{Miller2015BlissfullyHappyEmoji,
abstract = {Emoji are commonly used in modern text communication. However, as graphics with nuanced details, emoji may be open to interpretation. Emoji also render differently on different viewing platforms (e.g., Apple's iPhone vs. Google's Nexus phone), potentially leading to communication errors. We explore whether emoji renderings or differences across platforms give rise to diverse interpretations of emoji. Through an online survey, we solicit people's interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25{\%} of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase. Overall, we find significant potential for miscommunication, both for individual emoji renderings and for different emoji renderings across platforms.},

We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {We report on the largest corpus of user-chosen passwords ever studied, consisting of anonymized password histograms representing almost 70 million Yahoo! users, mitigating privacy concerns while enabling analysis of dozens of subpopulations based on demographic factors and site usage characteristics. This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties.

We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks.

Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited.

From this data we construct a model based on Markov chains that enables us to quantify the strength of Android unlock patterns. We found empiri- cally that there is a high bias in the pattern selection process, e. g., the upper left corner and three-point long straight lines are very typical selection strategies. Consequently, the en- tropy of patterns is rather low, and our results indicate that the security offered by the scheme is less than the security of only three digit randomly-assigned PINs for guessing 20{\%} of all passwords (i. e., we estimate a partial guessing entropy G0.2 of 9.10 bit). Based on these insights, we systematically improve the scheme by finding a small, but still effective change in the pattern layout that makes graphical user logins substantially more secure. By means of another user study, we show that some changes improve the security by more than doubling the space of actually used passwords (i. e., increasing the partial guessing entropy G0.2 to 10.81 bit).},

As an interesting practice of ubiquitous computing, emojis are adopted by Internet users from many different countries, on many devices (particularly popular on smartphones), and in many applications. The "ubiquitous" usage of emojis enables us to study and compare user behaviors and preferences across countries and cultures. We present an analysis on how smartphone users use emojis based on a very large data set collected from a popular emoji keyboard. The data set contains a complete month of emoji usage of 3.88 million active users from 212 countries and regions. We demonstrate that the categories and frequencies of emojis used by these users provide rich signals for the identification and the understanding of cultural differences of smartphone users. Users from different countries present significantly different preferences on emojis, which complies with the well-known Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.},

@inproceedings{Dellamico2015MonteCarlo,
abstract = {Modern password guessing attacks adopt sophisticated prob-abilistic techniques that allow for orders of magnitude less guesses to succeed compared to brute force. Unfortunately, best practices and password strength evaluators failed to keep up: they are generally based on heuristic rules designed to defend against obsolete brute force attacks. Many passwords can only be guessed with significant ef-fort, and motivated attackers may be willing to invest re-sources to obtain valuable passwords. However, it is em-inently impractical for the defender to simulate expensive attacks against each user to accurately characterize their password strength. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the number of guesses needed to find a password using modern attacks. The proposed method requires little resources, applies to a wide set of probabilistic models, and is characterised by highly desirable convergence properties. The experiments demonstrate the scalability and general-ity of the proposal. In particular, the experimental analysis reports evaluations on a wide range of password strengths, and of state-of-the-art attacks on very large datasets, includ-ing attacks that would have been prohibitively expensive to handle with existing simulation-based approaches.},

abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

Scholars have tried to explain this inconsistency between attitudes and behavior by suggesting that online users consciously weigh the trade-off between the costs and benefits of online information disclosure. We argue that online user behaviors are not always rational, but may occur due to expedient decision-making in the heat of the moment. Such decisions are based on cognitive heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb) rather than on a careful analysis of each transaction. Based on this premise, we seek to identify the specific triggers for disclosure of private information online. In the experiment reported here, we explore the operation of two specific heuristics-benefit and fuzzy boundary-in influencing privacy-related attitudes and behaviors. Theoretical and design implications are discussed.},

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.},

We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

However, the vast majority of studies on password security uses password lists that only have passwords for one site, which means that several important questions cannot be studied. For example, how much stronger are password choices for different categories of sites? We use a dataset which we extracted from a large dump of malware records. It contains multiple accounts (and passwords) per user and thus allows us to study both password re-use and the correlation between the value of an account and the strength of the passwords for those accounts. The first contribution of our study shows that users in our sample choose (substantially) stronger passwords for financial accounts than for low- value accounts, based on the extracted passwords as well as publicly available lists. This contribution has implications for password research, as some widely-used lists contain passwords much weaker than those used in the real world (for accounts of more than low value). In our second contribution, we measure password re-use taking account values into account. We see that although high-value passwords are stronger, they are re-used more frequently than low-value passwords – valuable passwords are identical to 21{\%} of the remaining passwords of a user. Before our study, little was known about password re-use for different account values.},

We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries. We found that while the interactive password strength meter and static fear appeal treatments were not effective, the interactive fear appeal treatment resulted in significantly stronger passwords. Our findings suggest that interactive fear appeals are a promising means of encouraging a range of secure behaviors in end users.},

Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

In-depth analysis of the interview data revealed that the degree to which users conform to security mechanisms depends on their perception of security levels, information sensitivity and compatibility with work practices.

1. What did the authors do?
- try to understand the password coping strategies of expert users (security experts)

2. How did they do it?
- semi-structured interviews (30 minutes), just like Password-Life cycle paper
- invitation from the group and few from the community
- no money paid to participants. 

3. What was their goal?
- give recommendations to non-expert users based on what the experts do
- identify flaws in experts' password management
- understand why certain strategies are preferable

4. What are the results?
- experts are more likely to use password managers
- password managers are mostly used for valuable accounts
- experts see password managers as cumbersome and an additional burden
- experts show consistency in their strategies
- experts also reuse passwords and write them down
- users write down passwords that they do not need often (so no interference effects!)
- experts have a lot more accounts that non-experts
- creative password creation strategies (experts can clearly communicate their algorithms)
- experts plan for failure (eg. don't use symbols or long passwords, in case they have to enter them on mobiles)
- risk assessment is highly personal and subjective
- there is a misconception that people think that only they have a certain password strategy.

5. What could be improved?
- understand individual motivation (biases) --{\textgreater} personalized strategies
- recruit at a conference instead of the own group
- boost ecological validity. show passwords and then ask "which password resembles your own email password the most? why?"

abstract = {As the Internet has grown, its user community has changed from a small tight-knit group of researchers to a loose gathering of people on a global network. The amazing and constantly growing numbers of machines and users ensures that untrustworthy individuals have full access to that network. High speed inter-machine communication and even higher speed computational processors have made the threats of system “crackers”, data theft, and data corruption very real. This paper outlines some of the problems of current password security by demonstrating the ease by which individual at counts may be broken. Various techniques used by crackers are outlined, and finally one solution to this point of system vulnerability, a proactive password checker, is documented.},

abstract = {We find that traditional password advice given to users is somewhat dated. Strong passwords do nothing to protect online users from password stealing attacks such as phishing and keylogging, and yet they place considerable burden on users. Passwords that are too weak of course invite brute-force attacks. However, we find that relatively weak passwords, about 20 bits or so, are sufficient to make brute-force attacks on a single account unrealistic so long as a "three strikes" type rule is in place. Above that minimum it appears that increasing password strength does little to address any real threat. If a larger credential space is needed it appears better to increase the strength of the userID's rather than the passwords. For large institutions this is just as effective in deterring bulk guessing attacks and is a great deal better for users. For small institutions there appears little reason to require strong passwords for online accounts.},

abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

@inproceedings{Kroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication,
abstract = {The fields of security and usability often conflict with each other. Security focuses on making systems difficult for attackers to compromise. However, doing this also increases difficulty for the user. Users in security are often seen as an obstacle - they are the weakest point of the system, willing to circumvent security policies in order to access their work faster. A large part of security is authentication: knowing who a user of a system is and denying access to unauthenticated users. Authentication is very often the starting point of user interaction with security systems. Unfortunately, authentication is still most commonly achieved using text-based passwords. This is often the easiest and cheapest system to implement. Most websites and services advise users to select unique, complex and lengthy passwords. These passwords are difficult for users to remember and often lead to irresponsible behaviour such as writing down or reusing passwords. Serious games are games that are designed for a different primary purpose than pure entertainment. This field includes gamification, where non-gaming contexts are enhanced by using principles from gaming. Examples include experience points, achievements, progress indicators and leader boards. Gamification uses these tools to persuade users to change their behaviour. If gamification can be applied to security, it may aid in convincing users to act more securely. This paper discusses the possibilities of applying gamification to authentication as a new approach to usability and security.},

Three hundred and fifteen undergraduate and graduate students completed a survey querying (1) the types and number of different password protected accounts maintained; (2) actual practices used in generating, storing and using passwords; (3) practices believed they should use in generating and storing passwords; and (4) general demographic information. Results indicate that, in general, users do not vary the complexity of passwords depending on the nature of the site (bank account vs. instant messenger) or change their passwords on any regular basis if it is not required by the site. Users report using lower case letters, numbers or digits, personally meaningful numbers and personally meaningful words when creating passwords, despite the fact that they realize that these methods may not be the most secure.},

@article{Novak2015SentimentOfEmojis,
abstract = {There is a new generation of emoticons, called emojis, that is increasingly being used in mobile communications and social media. In the past two years, over ten billion emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to the small number of well-known emoticons that carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what are their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the emojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4{\%} of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings between the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.},

abstract = {End-users are often perceived as the weakest link in information security. Because of this perception, a growing body of research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea for end-user information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security for end-users. We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions for end-users.},

@inproceedings{Mazurek2013Measuring,
abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

abstract = {Randomly generated alphanumeric passwords are widely used to restrict access to com- puter networks but are readily forgotten, resulting in costs to both organizations and users. In order to address this, there is a need to develop and evaluate new forms of memorable passwords. Drawing on memory research and the importance of meaning, the efficacy of three alternative “password” systems having varying degrees of personal meaning were compared with the more traditional but personally meaningless randomly generated alphanumeric passwords. Twenty experienced computer users self-generated four-string variable passwords based on alphanumerics, symbols of personal meaning and faces. Additionally, participants were assigned a meaningless, randomly generated four-character alphanumeric password. Password memorability was measured in terms of acquisition (number of trials/time to criterion), retention (fromforgetting functions) and retrieval (time to recall/recognize the passwords). Meaning was found to assist memora- bility and a mediating effect of familiarity was also observed. Contrary to expectation, self-generated, meaningful symbol-based passwords were not the best remembered of the password types studied but may still be a viable overall alternative.},

To help individuals avoid such regrets, we designed two modi- fications to the Facebook web interface that nudge users to consider the content and audience of their online disclosures more carefully. We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants' interactions with the nudges, the con- tent of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; how- ever, introducing a time delay before publishing users' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying. On bal- ance, some participants found the nudges helpful while oth- ers found them unnecessary or overly intrusive. We discuss implications and challenges for designing and evaluating sys- tems to assist users with online disclosures.},

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.},

Unlike traditional HIPs, where the computer issues a challenge to the user over a network, in this case, the user issues a challenge to the computer. This type of HIP can be used to detect phishing attacks, in which websites are spoofed in order to trick users into revealing private information. We define five properties of an ideal HIP to detect phishing attacks. Using these properties, we evaluate existing and proposed anti-phishing schemes to discover their benefits and weaknesses. We review a new anti-phishing proposal, Dynamic Security Skins (DSS), and show that it meets the HIP criteria. Our goal is to allow a remote server to prove its identity in a way that is easy for a human user to verify and hard for an attacker to spoof. In our scheme, the web server presents its proof in the form of an image that is unique for each user and each transaction. To authenticate the server, the user can visually verify that the image presented by the server matches a reference image presented by the browser.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62{\%} female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits - emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness - that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6–0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality.},

abstract = {Modern password guessing attacks adopt sophisticated prob-abilistic techniques that allow for orders of magnitude less guesses to succeed compared to brute force. Unfortunately, best practices and password strength evaluators failed to keep up: they are generally based on heuristic rules designed to defend against obsolete brute force attacks. Many passwords can only be guessed with significant ef-fort, and motivated attackers may be willing to invest re-sources to obtain valuable passwords. However, it is em-inently impractical for the defender to simulate expensive attacks against each user to accurately characterize their password strength. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the number of guesses needed to find a password using modern attacks. The proposed method requires little resources, applies to a wide set of probabilistic models, and is characterised by highly desirable convergence properties. The experiments demonstrate the scalability and general-ity of the proposal. In particular, the experimental analysis reports evaluations on a wide range of password strengths, and of state-of-the-art attacks on very large datasets, includ-ing attacks that would have been prohibitively expensive to handle with existing simulation-based approaches.},

abstract = {We report on the largest corpus of user-chosen passwords ever studied, consisting of anonymized password histograms representing almost 70 million Yahoo! users, mitigating privacy concerns while enabling analysis of dozens of subpopulations based on demographic factors and site usage characteristics. This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

abstract = {Theory on passwords has lagged behind practice, where large providers use back-end smarts to survive with imperfect technology. Simplistic models of user and attacker behaviors have led the research community to emphasize the wrong threats. Authentication is a classification problem amenable to machine learning, with many signals in addition to the password available to large Web services. Passwords will continue as a useful signal for the foreseeable future, where the goal is not impregnable security but reducing harm at acceptable cost.},

These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements.},

We propose a novel CAPTCHA called EmojiTCHA which utilizes symbolic representations of human emotions in the form of emojis correlated to an image of real humans expressing the same emotion on their face. By leveraging the Project Oxford Emotion API from Microsoft's cognitive services platform, which provides automated detection of human emotion expressions on human faces, we generate a tagged dataset in an automated fashion. Through the use of image warping and distortion techniques, we can significantly increase the robustness of the CAPTCHA against automated attacks, without compromising on usability, as confirmed by our user study.},

abstract = {The fact that a majority of Internet users appear unharmed each year is difficult to reconcile with a weakest-link analysis. We seek to explain this enormous gap between potential and actual harm. The answer, we find, lies in the fact that an Internet attacker, who attacks en masse, faces a sum-of-effort rather than a weakest-link defense. Large-scale attacks must be profitable in expectation, not merely in particular scenarios. For example, knowing the dog's name may open an occasional bank account, but the cost of determining one million users' dogs' names is far greater than that information is worth. The strategy that appears simple in isolation leads to bankruptcy in expectation. Many attacks cannot be made profitable, even when many profitable targets exist. We give several examples of insecure practices which should be exploited by a weakest-link attacker but are extremely difficult to turn into profitable attacks.},

@inproceedings{Cranor2008FrameworkReasoning,
abstract = {Many secure systems rely on a “human in the loop” to perform security-critical functions. However, humans often fail in their security roles. Whenever possible, secure system designers should find ways of keeping humans out of the loop. However, there are some tasks for which feasible or cost effective alternatives to humans are not available. In these cases secure system designers should engineer their systems to support the humans in the loop and maxi- mize their chances of performing their security-critical functions successfully. We propose a framework for reason- ing about the human in the loop that provides a systematic approach to identifying potential causes for human fail- ure. This framework can be used by system designers to identify problem areas before a system is built and proac- tively address deficiencies. System operators can also use this framework to analyze the root cause of security failures that have been attributed to “human error.” We provide examples to illustrate the applicability of this framework to a variety of secure systems design problems, including anti-phishing warnings and password policies.},

We performed a laboratory experiment to examine whether these meters influenced users' password selections when they were forced to change their real passwords, and when they were not told that their passwords were the subject of a study. We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

abstract = {In the past, research on password mechanisms has focussed almost entirely on technical issues. Only in recent years has the security research community acknowledged that user behavior plays a part in many security failures, and that policies alone may not be sufficient to ensure correct behavior. We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind. We present the results of a first study that can guide such persuasive efforts, and describe methods that can be used to persuade users to employ proper password practice.},

We conducted three between-subjects experiments to test the effectiveness of the attractors. In the first two experiments, we sent participants to per- form a task on what appeared to be a third-party site that required installation of a browser plugin. We presented them with what appeared to be an installation dialog from their operating system. Participants who saw dialogs that em- ployed inhibitive attractors were significantly less likely than those in the control group to ignore clues that installing this software might be harmful. In the third experiment, we attempted to habituate par- ticipants to dialogs that they knew were part of the experi- ment. We used attractors to highlight a field that was of no value during habituation trials and contained critical infor- mation after the habituation period. Participants exposed to inhibitive attractors were two to three times more likely to make an informed decision than those in the control con- dition. Categories},

This change in population points to how workers may treat Turking as a full-time job, which they rely on to make ends meet.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

There is however a severe lack of scientific data on users' current unlocking behavior and perceptions. We performed an online survey (n = 260) and a one-month field study (n = 52) to gain insights into real world (un)locking behavior of smartphone users. One of the main goals was to find out how much overhead unlocking and authenticating adds to the overall phone usage and in how many unlock interactions security (i.e. authentication) was perceived as necessary. We also investigated why users do or do not use a lock screen and how they cope with smartphone-related risks, such as shouldersurfing or unwanted accesses. Among other results, we found that on average, participants spent around 2.9 {\%} of their smartphone interaction time with authenticating (9 {\%} in the worst case). Participants that used a secure lock screen like PIN or Android unlock patterns considered it unnecessary in 24.1 {\%} of situations. Shoulder surfing was perceived to be a relevant risk in only 11 of 3410 sampled situations.},

abstract = {Online social networks have enabled new methods and modalities of collaboration and sharing. These advances bring privacy concerns: online social data is more accessible and persistent and simultaneously less contextualized than traditional social interactions. To allay these concerns, many web services allow users to configure their privacy settings based on a set of multiple-choice questions.We suggest a new paradigm for privacy options. Instead of suggesting the same defaults to each user, services can leverage knowledge of users' traits to recommend a machine-learned prediction of their privacy preferences for Facebook. As a case study, we build and evaluate MyPrivacy, a publicly available web application that suggests personalized privacy settings. An evaluation with 199 users shows that users find the suggestions to be appropriate and private; furthermore, they express intent to implement the recommendations made by MyPrivacy. This supports the proposal to put personalization to work in online communities to promote privacy and security.},

@misc{Acar2016NotYourDeveloper,
abstract = {While researchers have developed many tools, techniques, and protocols for improving software security, exploits and breaches are only becoming more frequent. Some of this gap between theoretical security and actual vulnerability can be explained by insufficient consideration of human factors, broadly termed usability, when developing these mechanisms. In particular, security mechanisms may be difficult to use, may conflict with other priorities, or may assume more security knowledge than users possess. For almost 20 years, the usable security community has investigated how to improve the usability of security tools and interfaces aimed at end users. More recently, the community has begun to apply similar techniques in the context of improving security tools - such as APIs and bug-finding software - aimed not at end users but at developers, whose security errors are magnified across all users of their products. In this paper, we review key lessons learned from usable security for end users and consider how to apply them in the context of developers. We propose a research agenda aimed at developing a high-quality, comprehensive literature for usable security for developers, including: investigating how to conduct reliable research in this context, understanding developers' attitudes, knowledge, and priorities, measuring the status quo, and developing improved tools and interventions in the future.},

This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

abstract = {Online banking is one of the most sensitive tasks performed by general Internet users. Most traditional banks now offer online banking services, and strongly encourage customers to do online banking with ‘peace of mind.' Although banks heavily advertise an apparent ‘100{\%} online security guaran- tee,' typically the fine print makes this conditional on users fulfilling certain security requirements. We examine some of these requirements as set by major Canadian banks, in terms of security and usability. We opened personal check- ing accounts at the five largest Canadian banks, and one online-only bank. We found that many security require- ments are too difficult for regular users to follow, and be- lieve that some marketing-related messages about safety and security actually mislead users. We are also interested in what kind of computer systems people really use for online banking, and whether users satisfy common online bank- ing requirements. Our survey of 123 technically advanced users from a university environment strongly supports our view of an emerging gap between banks' expectations (or at least what their written customer policy agreements imply) and users' actions related to security requirements of online banking. Our participants, being more security-aware than the general population, arguably makes our results best-case regarding what can be expected from regular users. Yet most participants failed to satisfy common security require- ments, implying most online banking customers do not (or cannot) follow banks' stated end-user security requirements and guidelines. The survey also sheds light on the security settings of systems used for sensitive online transactions. This work is intended to spur a discussion on real-world sys- tem security and user responsibilities, in a scenario where everyday users are heavily encouraged to perform critical tasks over the Internet, despite the continuing absence of appropriate tools to do so.},

Users often do not understand enough about the impact of a security decision to make an informed choice. We report on the experience in a 500-person organization on the security of each user's Lotus Notes client against unsigned active content. We found that the default configuration of the majority of users did not allow unsigned active content to run. However, we found that when presented with a choice during their workflow, many of those otherwise secured users would allow unsigned active content to run. We discuss the features that are in Lotus Notes that provide security for active content and that respond to the usability issues from this study.},

Categories of graphical passwords have been distinguished on the basis of di↵erent kinds of memory retrieval (recall, cued-recall, and recognition). Psychological research suggests that leveraging recognition memory should be best, but this remains an open question in the password literature. This paper examines how di↵erent kinds of memory retrieval a↵ect the memorability and usability of random assigned graphical passwords. A series of five studies of graphical and text passwords showed that participants were able to better remember recognition-based graphical passwords, but their usability was limited by slow login times. A graphical password scheme that leveraged recognition and recall memory was most successful at combining memorability and usability.},

We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users' stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

We conducted a series of interviews to investigate how users cope with these demanding tasks, and used Grounded Theory to analyze the interview results. We found that most users cope by reusing passwords and writing them down, but with a rich variety of behaviour and diverse personalized strategies. These approaches seem to disregard security advice, but at a detailed level they involve perceptive behaviour and careful self-management of user resources. We identify a password life cycle that follows users' password behaviour and how it develops over time as users adapt to changing circumstances and demands. Users' strategies have their limitations, but we suggest they indicate a rational response to the requirements of password authentication. We suggest that instead of simply advising against such behaviour, new approaches could be designed that harness existing user behaviour while limiting negative consequences.},

Strong passwords do nothing to protect online users from password stealing attacks such as phishing and keylogging, and yet they place considerable burden on users. Passwords that are too weak of course invite brute-force attacks. However, we find that relatively weak passwords, about 20 bits or so, are sufficient to make brute-force attacks on a single account unrealistic so long as a "three strikes" type rule is in place. Above that minimum it appears that increasing password strength does little to address any real threat. If a larger credential space is needed it appears better to increase the strength of the userID's rather than the passwords. For large institutions this is just as effective in deterring bulk guessing attacks and is a great deal better for users. For small institutions there appears little reason to require strong passwords for online accounts.},

When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries.

abstract = {Violations of published strictures on password use have led to widespread unauthorized access to computer systems. The problem may compound as inexpert users, handicapped by inadequate guidance and ignorance of computers, are increasingly involved on networked, supposedly "user-friendly" workstations. The literature on password methods reflects a technocentric focus emphasizing security without due regard for user comfort, i.e., a "user-hostile", system perspective. We present a "user-friendly" model for the password selection and re-creation processes rooted in cognitive psychology. The model suggests two approaches to password selection - one rooted in a nomothetic, or particularized, the other in an idiographic, or generalized, treatment of experience - that exploit principles of recall, memory aids and simple formal transformations. A third approach, exploiting environmental cues - hence recognition rather than recall - is also considered. Intermediate approaches enable tradeoffs between password security and memorability appropriate to the context and cognitive style of the user. The reduction of the approaches to practice is illustrated in numerous examples. The approaches yield passwords more vulnerable to discovery than those envisioned in system-oriented theory, yet operationally superior to many prompted by strictures reflecting a technocentric system perspective. We recommend that guidance materials on password use be made available on systems. ?? 1984.},

Human users are the 'weakest link' in password control, due to our propensity to reuse passwords and to create weak ones. Policies which forbid such unsafe password practices are often violated, even if these policies are well-advertised. We have studied how users perceive their accounts and their passwords. Our participants mentally classified their accounts and passwords into a few groups, based on a small number of perceived similarities. Our participants used stronger passwords, and reused passwords less, in account groups which they considered more important. Our participants thus demonstrated awareness of the basic tenets of password safety, but they did not behave safely in all respects. Almost half of our participants reused at least one of the passwords in their high-importance accounts. Our findings add to the body of evidence that a typical computer user suffers from 'password overload'. Our concepts of password and account grouping point the way toward more intuitive user interfaces for password and account-management systems. {\textcopyright} 2009, Australian Computer Society, Inc.},

3 months large scale user study to measure password strength and frequency metrics.

The study analysed the way of how passwords are used, their strength, number of accounts. Also which password type/length is used for which type of website

3) Was war ihr Ziel?

Find out how large the role of web passwords is in users lives.

4) Was haben sie herausgefunden?

The results confirm previous estimations about password weakness and reuse of passwords. In contrast to those estimations the study's resulting dataset allows to analyse users password habits in more statistical and viable ways. 

"The average password appears to be used at about 6 different sites"

Study analysis shows that users certainly have more passwords than they might remember in combination with the correct website and credentials even though most passwords are weak due to higher memorability. The results show that passwords are reused a lot and the average time between logins is more than 5 days (according to the 20 most commonly used login sites in 2007).

Passwords are forgotten a lot:
"For the example of Yahoo, password change operations occurred 15 {\%} as frequently as sign-in operations."

abstract = {We conduct a security analysis of five popular web-based password managers. Unlike “local” password managers, web-based password managers run in the browser. We identify four key security concerns for web-based pass- word managers and, for each, identify representative vul- nerabilities through our case studies. Our attacks are se- vere: in four out of the five password managers we stud- ied, an attacker can learn a user's credentials for arbi- trary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared pass- words. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also di- verse: ranging from logic and authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in ad- dition to the typical vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure. To guide future de- velopment of password managers, we provide guidance for password managers. Given the diversity of vulner- abilities we identified, we advocate a defense-in-depth approach to ensure security of password managers},

abstract = {We present a usability study of two recent password manager proposals: PwdHash (Ross et al., 2005) and Password Multiplier (Halderman et al., 2005). Both papers considered usability issues in greater than typical detail, the former briefly reporting on a small usability study; both also provided implementations for download. Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

abstract = {We explore how to manage a portfolio of passwords. We review why mandating exclusively strong passwords with no re-use gives users an impossible task as portfolio size grows. We find that approaches justified by loss-minimization alone, and those that ignore important attack vectors (e.g., vectors exploiting re-use), are amenable to analysis but unrealistic. In contrast, we propose, model and analyze portfolio management under a realistic attack suite, with an objective function costing both loss and user effort. Our findings directly challenge accepted wisdom and conventional advice. We find, for example, that a portfolio strategy ruling out weak passwords or password re-use is sub-optimal. We give an optimal solution for how to group accounts for re-use, and model-based principles for portfolio management.},

abstract = {Today's Internet services rely heavily on text-based passwords for user authentication. The pervasiveness of these services coupled with the difficulty of remembering large numbers of secure passwords tempts users to reuse passwords at multiple sites. In this paper, we investigate for the first time how an attacker can leverage a known password from one site to more easily guess that user's password at other sites. We study several hundred thousand leaked passwords from eleven web sites and conduct a user survey on password reuse; we estimate that 43- 51{\%} of users reuse the same password across multiple sites. We further identify a few simple tricks users often employ to transform a basic password between sites which can be used by an attacker to make password guessing vastly easier. We develop the first cross-site password-guessing algorithm, which is able to guess 30{\%} of transformed passwords within 100 attempts compared to just 14{\%} for a standard password-guessing algorithm without cross-site password knowledge.},

We performed a laboratory experiment to examine whether these meters influenced users' password selections when they were forced to change their real passwords, and when they were not told that their passwords were the subject of a study. We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

We also investigated why users do or do not use a lock screen and how they cope with smartphone-related risks, such as shouldersurfing or unwanted accesses. Among other results, we found that on average, participants spent around 2.9 {\%} of their smartphone interaction time with authenticating (9 {\%} in the worst case). Participants that used a secure lock screen like PIN or Android unlock patterns considered it unnecessary in 24.1 {\%} of situations. Shoulder surfing was perceived to be a relevant risk in only 11 of 3410 sampled situations.},

We further introduce Tapas, a concrete implementation of dual-possession authentication leveraging a desktop computer and a smartphone. Tapas requires no server-side changes to websites, no master password, and protects all the stored passwords in the event either the primary or secondary device (e.g., computer or phone) is stolen. To evaluate the viability of Tapas as an alternative to traditional password managers, we perform a 30 participant user study comparing Tapas to two configurations of Firefox's built-in password manager. We found users significantly preferred Tapas. We then improve Tapas by incorporating feedback from this study, and reevaluate it with an additional 10 participants. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

After they entered their chosen password correctly we displayed a short code (4 letters or 2 words, 18.8 bits) that we required them to type. For subsequent logins we added an increasing de- lay prior to displaying the code, which participants could avoid by typing the code from memory. As participants learned, we added two more codes to comprise a 56.4- bit secret. Overall, 94{\%} of participants eventually typed their entire secret from memory, learning it after a me- dian of 36 logins. The learning component of our system added a median delay of just 6.9 s per login and a to- tal of less than 12 minutes over an average of ten days. 88{\%} were able to recall their codes exactly when asked at least three days later, with only 21{\%} reporting having written their secret down. As one participant wrote with surprise, “the words are branded into my brain.” While our study is preliminary in nature, we believe it debunks the myth that users are inherently incapable of remem- bering cryptographically-strong secrets for a select few high-stakes scenarios, such as a password for enterprise login or as a master key to protect other credentials (e.g., in a password manager).},

abstract = {OpenID and InfoCard are two mainstream Web single sign- on (SSO) solutions intended for Internet-scale adoption. While they are technically sound, the business model of these solu- tions does not provide content-hosting and service providers (CSPs) with sucient incentives to become relying parties (RPs). In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adop- tion for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must of- fer RPs sucient business incentives and trustworthy iden- tity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks. Moreover, we propose that Web SSO technol- ogy should build identity support into browsers in order to facilitate RPs' adoption.},

abstract = {Current systems for banking authentication require that customers not reveal their access codes, even to members of the family. A study of banking and security in Australia shows that the practice of sharing passwords does not conform to this requirement. For married and de facto couples, password sharing is seen as a practical way of managing money and a demonstration of trust. Sharing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) is a common practice among remote indigenous communities in Australia. In areas with poor banking access, this is the only way to access cash. People with certain disabilities have to share passwords with carers, and PIN numbers with retail clerks. In this paper we present the findings of a qualitative user study of banking and money management. We suggest design criteria for banking security systems, based on observed social and cultural practices of password and PIN number sharing.},

abstract = {Modern password guessing attacks adopt sophisticated prob-abilistic techniques that allow for orders of magnitude less guesses to succeed compared to brute force. Unfortunately, best practices and password strength evaluators failed to keep up: they are generally based on heuristic rules designed to defend against obsolete brute force attacks. Many passwords can only be guessed with significant ef-fort, and motivated attackers may be willing to invest re-sources to obtain valuable passwords. However, it is em-inently impractical for the defender to simulate expensive attacks against each user to accurately characterize their password strength. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the number of guesses needed to find a password using modern attacks. The proposed method requires little resources, applies to a wide set of probabilistic models, and is characterised by highly desirable convergence properties. The experiments demonstrate the scalability and general-ity of the proposal. In particular, the experimental analysis reports evaluations on a wide range of password strengths, and of state-of-the-art attacks on very large datasets, includ-ing attacks that would have been prohibitively expensive to handle with existing simulation-based approaches.},

Self-awareness induced by the presence of a mirror placed behind the candy bowl decreased transgression rates for children who had been individuated by asking them their name and address, but did not affect the behavior of children left anonymous. Self-awareness influenced older but not younger children. Naturally occurring standards instituted by the behavior of the first child to approach the candy bowl in each group were shown to interact with the experimenter's verbally stated standard. The behavior of 349 subjects in the second study replicated the findings in the first study. Additionally, when no standard was stated by the experimenter, children took more candy when not self-aware than when self-aware.},

abstract = {This paper studies the security and memorability of free-form multitouch gestures for mobile authentication. Towards this end, we collected a dataset with a generate-test-retest paradigm where participants (N=63) generated free-form gestures, repeated them, and were later retested for memory. Half of the participants decided to generate one-finger gestures, and the other half generated multi-finger gestures. Although there has been recent work on template-based gestures, there are yet no metrics to analyze security of either template or free-form gestures. For example, entropy-based metrics used for text-based passwords are not suitable for capturing the security and memorability of free-form gestures. Hence, we modify a recently proposed metric for analyzing information capacity of continuous full-body movements for this purpose. Our metric computed estimated mutual information in repeated sets of gestures. Surprisingly, one-finger gestures had higher average mutual information. Gestures with many hard angles and turns had the highest mutual information. The best-remembered gestures included signatures and simple angular shapes. We also implemented a multitouch recognizer to evaluate the practicality of free-form gestures in a real authentication system and how they perform against shoulder surfing attacks. We discuss strategies for generating secure and memorable free-form gestures. We conclude that free-form gestures present a robust method for mobile authentication.},

abstract = {Today's Internet services rely heavily on text-based passwords for user authentication. The pervasiveness of these services coupled with the difficulty of remembering large numbers of secure passwords tempts users to reuse passwords at multiple sites. In this paper, we investigate for the first time how an attacker can leverage a known password from one site to more easily guess that user's password at other sites. We study several hundred thousand leaked passwords from eleven web sites and conduct a user survey on password reuse; we estimate that 43- 51{\%} of users reuse the same password across multiple sites. We further identify a few simple tricks users often employ to transform a basic password between sites which can be used by an attacker to make password guessing vastly easier. We develop the first cross-site password-guessing algorithm, which is able to guess 30{\%} of transformed passwords within 100 attempts compared to just 14{\%} for a standard password-guessing algorithm without cross-site password knowledge.},

Whenever possible, secure system designers should find ways of keeping humans out of the loop. However, there are some tasks for which feasible or cost effective alternatives to humans are not available. In these cases secure system designers should engineer their systems to support the humans in the loop and maxi- mize their chances of performing their security-critical functions successfully. We propose a framework for reason- ing about the human in the loop that provides a systematic approach to identifying potential causes for human fail- ure. This framework can be used by system designers to identify problem areas before a system is built and proac- tively address deficiencies. System operators can also use this framework to analyze the root cause of security failures that have been attributed to “human error.” We provide examples to illustrate the applicability of this framework to a variety of secure systems design problems, including anti-phishing warnings and password policies.},

Scholars have tried to explain this inconsistency between attitudes and behavior by suggesting that online users consciously weigh the trade-off between the costs and benefits of online information disclosure. We argue that online user behaviors are not always rational, but may occur due to expedient decision-making in the heat of the moment. Such decisions are based on cognitive heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb) rather than on a careful analysis of each transaction. Based on this premise, we seek to identify the specific triggers for disclosure of private information online. In the experiment reported here, we explore the operation of two specific heuristics-benefit and fuzzy boundary-in influencing privacy-related attitudes and behaviors. Theoretical and design implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Users tend to form their own mental models of good passwords regardless of any instructions provided. They also tend to favour memorability over security. In our study comparing two mnemonic phrase-based password schemes, we found a surprising number of participants misused both schemes. Intentional or not, they misused the system such that their task of password creation and memorization became easier. Thus, we believe that instead of better instructions or password schemes, a new approach is required to convince users to create more secure passwords. One possibility may lie in employing Persuasive Technology.},

@inproceedings{Kang2015MentalModelsDrawing,
abstract = {Many people use the Internet every day yet know little about how it really works. Prior literature diverges on how people's Internet knowledge affects their privacy and security decisions. We undertook a qualitative study to understand what people do and do not know about the Internet and how that knowledge affects their responses to privacy and security risks. Lay people, as compared to those with computer science or related backgrounds, had simpler mental models that omitted Internet levels, organizations, and entities. People with more articulated technical models perceived more privacy threats, possibly driven by their more accurate understanding of where specific risks could occur in the network. Despite these differences, we did not find a direct relationship between people's technical background and the actions they took to control their privacy or increase their security online. Consistent with other work on user knowledge and experience, our study suggests a greater emphasis on policies and systems that protect privacy and security without relying too much},

annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- try to find out user's mental models about
the internet and privacy issues
- privacy paradox / what hampers actions?

2. How did they do it?
- qualitative study with drawing tasks
- 28 participants, video recording
- coding of dimensions in which drawings differed
- divided into laymen, techical people, and sampled
from the community (older)

3. What was their goal?
- understand misconceptions about entities on the web
- understand how users perceive attack vectors

4. What are the results?
- strong differences depending on the educational background
- no IT background: simple, service oriented mental models,
- technical background: multi-layer environment with
entities and organizations.
- most often, people get more privacy sensitive by experiencing breaches or harmful activity. 
- technical background does not lead to more actions taken

5. What could be improved?
- sample size with 28
- sample population is mostly students / university staff
- show all drawings
- conceptualize the mental models better (not just tables)},

abstract = {Two field studies explored the relationship between self-awareness and transgressive behavior. In the first study, 363 Halloween trick-or-treaters were instructed to only take one candy. Self-awareness induced by the presence of a mirror placed behind the candy bowl decreased transgression rates for children who had been individuated by asking them their name and address, but did not affect the behavior of children left anonymous. Self-awareness influenced older but not younger children. Naturally occurring standards instituted by the behavior of the first child to approach the candy bowl in each group were shown to interact with the experimenter's verbally stated standard. The behavior of 349 subjects in the second study replicated the findings in the first study. Additionally, when no standard was stated by the experimenter, children took more candy when not self-aware than when self-aware.},

@article{Marengo2017,
abstract = {The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62{\%} female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits - emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness - that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6–0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality.},

@article{Novak2015SentimentOfEmojis,
abstract = {There is a new generation of emoticons, called emojis, that is increasingly being used in mobile communications and social media. In the past two years, over ten billion emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to the small number of well-known emoticons that carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what are their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the emojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4{\%} of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings between the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.},

@inproceedings{Conklin2004PWAuthenticationSystemPerspective,
abstract = {User authentication in computer systems has been a cornerstone of computer security for decades. The concept of a user id and password is a cost effective and efficient method of maintaining a shared secret between a user and a computer system. One of the key elements in the password solution for security is a reliance on human cognitive ability to remember the shared secret. In early computing days with only a few computer systems and a small select group of users, this model proved effective. With the advent of the Internet, e-commerce, and the proliferation of PCs in offices and schools, the user base has grown both in number and in demographic base. Individual users no longer have single passwords for single systems, but are presented with the challenge of remembering numerous passwords for numerous systems, from email, to web accounts, to banking and financial services. This paper presents a conceptual model depicting how users and systems work together in this function and examines the consequences of the expanding user base and the use of password memory aids. A system model of the risks associated with password-based authentication is presented from a user centric point of view including the construct of user password memory aids. When confronted with too much data to remember, users develop memory aids to assist them in the task of remembering important pieces of information. These user password memory aids form a bridge between otherwise unconnected systems and have an effect on system level security across multiple systems interconnected by the user. A preliminary analysis of the implications of this user centric interconnection of security models is presented.},

abstract = {We report on the largest corpus of user-chosen passwords ever studied, consisting of anonymized password histograms representing almost 70 million Yahoo! users, mitigating privacy concerns while enabling analysis of dozens of subpopulations based on demographic factors and site usage characteristics. This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

By dividing these users into three groups, our controlled study measured both the effect of extended validation certificates that appear only at legitimate sites and the effect of reading a help file about security features in Internet Explorer 7. Across all groups, we found that picture-in-picture attacks showing a fake browser window were as effective as the best other phishing technique, the homograph attack. Extended validation did not help users identify either attack. Additionally, reading the help file made users more likely to classify both real and fake web sites as legitimate when the phishing warning did not appear.},

@inproceedings{Chiasson2006PasswordManagers,
abstract = {We present a usability study of two recent password manager proposals: PwdHash (Ross et al., 2005) and Password Multiplier (Halderman et al., 2005). Both papers considered usability issues in greater than typical detail, the former briefly reporting on a small usability study; both also provided implementations for download. Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

abstract = {Under certain circumstances, consumers are willing to pay a premium for privacy. We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users' stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

@inproceedings{Paiva2017Passfault,
abstract = {Most intelligent systems need a reliable authentication method in order to assure the security of sensitive information and devices, and vulnerable combinations of username and password make it easy for devices and accounts to be compromised by attackers. Big corporations have had their databases stolen, leaving millions of accounts compromised. Although many systems encourage users to select good passwords by enforcing policies, modern cracking techniques have proved such strategies to be insufficient. Along with easily guessable passwords, password reutilization is a common practice among average users, which might lead to a wide range of social engineering and privilege escalation techniques. An accurate evaluation of a password's resistance to being cracked has proved to be a critical challenge. This paper describes Passfault, which is an Open Source tool maintained by OWASP that poses as a promising method of making sure passwords will not be cracked. A solid mathematical foundation is presented, and Passfault's results over the famous password list RockYou are described. Then, the most popular password rules found in the list are used to simulate an attack against a recently leaked hash list, providing statistical insight about how corporations and users are managing their passwords},

@inproceedings{Forget2015CYOA,
abstract = {To solve the long-standing problems users have in creating and re- membering text passwords, a wide variety of alternative authenti- cation schemes have been proposed. Some of these schemes out- perform others by various metrics in various contexts. However, none unilaterally outperform all others, and so text passwords per- sist as the main scheme applications depend upon. In this paper, we challenge the long-standing assumption that only one authen- tication scheme can be offered by an application service. We pro- pose Choose Your Own Authentication (CYOA); a novel authenti- cation architecture that enables users to choose a scheme amongst several available alternatives. CYOA would enable users to select whichever scheme best suits their preferences, abilities, and usage context. Existing text password systems could easily be replaced. Furthermore, the three-party architecture would enable delegating the management of authentication systems to trusted-third parties. The architecture allows rapid deployment and testing of novel au- thentication technologies. Our two-week usability study suggests that participants were willing to leverage alternative schemes. Par- ticipants were confident that CYOA could keep their financial in- formation},
address = {Twente, The Netherlands},
annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- the authors propose a system that lets the users choose their own authentication scheme.
- available schemes: Persuasive Text Passwords, Persuasive Cued Click Points, object passtiles, text passwords (baseline)

2. How did they do it?
- they conducted a small, 2 week user study with 39 participants who were prompted to log in to web sites from the MVP web-auth framework (see [5]). 

3. What was their goal?
- find evidence for/against hypotheses: h1: user do not prefer one over the other; h2: the users first take the time to learn sth about the available schemes; h3: users like CYOA

4. What are the results?
- surprise surprise: all hypotheses were confirmed. 
- users avoided Persuasive Text Password for their second account. 
- no preference of text passwords
- when people tried out a novel scheme, they switched back to text passwords and vice versa.
- users who spend more time reading the intro, were more likely to use novel schemes.
- users don't base their choice on security concerns.
- users did not switch their chosen scheme when resetting.

5. What could be improved?
- the conclusions are clearly flawed.
- the participants simply were open-minded study participants who also would behave differently in real life. 
- the statistics are traditional hypothesis tests that cannot be taken too seriously with this N
- within two weeks for artificial, uninteresting accounts it's no surprise that users did not reset their passwords / schemes. 
- the chosen schemes were all published by the authors and no one else likes them. authors were clearly biased in favor of them. 

Ah. The idea is great, but I really hate how they put it into practice and what they claim with their study. They could have done better.

abstract = {Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries. We found that while the interactive password strength meter and static fear appeal treatments were not effective, the interactive fear appeal treatment resulted in significantly stronger passwords. Our findings suggest that interactive fear appeals are a promising means of encouraging a range of secure behaviors in end users.},

@article{Renaud2009VisualSnakeOil,
abstract = {Users of computer systems are accustomed to being asked for passwords -- it is as universal as it is frustrating. In the past there was little tolerance for the problems experienced remembering passwords, and many users still remember, with embarrassment, having to go hat-in-hand to request a password change and being treated with disdain by a lofty administrator. Latterly there is more understanding of the problems experienced by users, especially since the "password conundrum" has reached epidemic proportions for Web users, who are asked for passwords with unrelenting predictability. The problems with passwords are clear -- users cannot remember numbers of meaningless alphanumeric strings with ease. Hence, they react by choosing simple and predictable words or numbers related to their everyday life, and engaging in insecure practices, such as writing passwords down or sharing them. These practices cause a breach affecting even the most secure and protected network system. Hence the user is often called the weakest link of the security chain, with system administrators despairing of trying to maintain security with the weak link so often reaching breaking point. Users forgetting passwords has serious economical consequences for organizations. Both academia and industry have been investigating alternatives to passwords, with varying degrees of success. One of the most well-known solutions is the biometric -- measurement of either behavioral or physiological characteristics of the end-user. This is obviously superior to the password because it removes the burden on the user's memory. So why don't we just switch to biometrics and give the poor user a break? There are some valid and hard-to-overcome reasons for the slow uptake of biometrics, but before we can discuss them we need to consider the mechanics of authentication.},

We also find that user behavior varies acrosswarnings. In con- trast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2{\%} of Google Chrome's SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can have a significant impact on user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers.},

@inproceedings{Mannan2007SecurityUsability,
abstract = {Online banking is one of the most sensitive tasks performed by general Internet users. Most traditional banks now offer online banking services, and strongly encourage customers to do online banking with ‘peace of mind.' Although banks heavily advertise an apparent ‘100{\%} online security guaran- tee,' typically the fine print makes this conditional on users fulfilling certain security requirements. We examine some of these requirements as set by major Canadian banks, in terms of security and usability. We opened personal check- ing accounts at the five largest Canadian banks, and one online-only bank. We found that many security require- ments are too difficult for regular users to follow, and be- lieve that some marketing-related messages about safety and security actually mislead users. We are also interested in what kind of computer systems people really use for online banking, and whether users satisfy common online bank- ing requirements. Our survey of 123 technically advanced users from a university environment strongly supports our view of an emerging gap between banks' expectations (or at least what their written customer policy agreements imply) and users' actions related to security requirements of online banking. Our participants, being more security-aware than the general population, arguably makes our results best-case regarding what can be expected from regular users. Yet most participants failed to satisfy common security require- ments, implying most online banking customers do not (or cannot) follow banks' stated end-user security requirements and guidelines. The survey also sheds light on the security settings of systems used for sensitive online transactions. This work is intended to spur a discussion on real-world sys- tem security and user responsibilities, in a scenario where everyday users are heavily encouraged to perform critical tasks over the Internet, despite the continuing absence of appropriate tools to do so.},

In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

Only in recent years has the security research community acknowledged that user behavior plays a part in many security failures, and that policies alone may not be sufficient to ensure correct behavior. We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind. We present the results of a first study that can guide such persuasive efforts, and describe methods that can be used to persuade users to employ proper password practice.},

@article{Uellenbeck2013QuantifyingSecurityPatterns,
abstract = {Graphical passwords were proposed as an alternative to over- come the inherent limitations of text-based passwords, in- spired by research that shows that the graphical memory of humans is particularly well developed. A graphical password scheme that has been widely adopted is the Android Unlock Pattern, a special case of the Pass-Go scheme with grid size restricted to 3×3 points and restricted stroke count. In this paper, we study the security of Android unlock pat- terns. By performing a large-scale user study, we measure actual user choices of patterns instead of theoretical consid- erations on password spaces. From this data we construct a model based on Markov chains that enables us to quantify the strength of Android unlock patterns. We found empiri- cally that there is a high bias in the pattern selection process, e. g., the upper left corner and three-point long straight lines are very typical selection strategies. Consequently, the en- tropy of patterns is rather low, and our results indicate that the security offered by the scheme is less than the security of only three digit randomly-assigned PINs for guessing 20{\%} of all passwords (i. e., we estimate a partial guessing entropy G0.2 of 9.10 bit). Based on these insights, we systematically improve the scheme by finding a small, but still effective change in the pattern layout that makes graphical user logins substantially more secure. By means of another user study, we show that some changes improve the security by more than doubling the space of actually used passwords (i. e., increasing the partial guessing entropy G0.2 to 10.81 bit).},

We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

The lack of adoption of privacy enhancing technologies is explained as a societal failure, i.e., that people don??t care. Security designers consider the individual user to be rational, certain, and self-optimizing. Thus, academic and practitioner efforts have focused on incentive alignment and education. But even the effectiveness of initiatives such as security education can be improved if well-known human decision heuristics are taken as initial inputs to improve technical solutions, rather than sources of failure to be bemoaned.},

However, in our own research, we show that the five factor model is actually a weak predictor of privacy preferences and behaviors, and that other well-studied individual differences in the psychol-ogy literature are much stronger predictors. We describe the results of several experiments that showed how decision-making style and risk-taking attitudes are strong predictors of privacy attitudes, as well as a new scale that we devel-oped to measure security behavior intentions.

In response to this threat, password composition policies have grown increasingly complex. However, there is insufficient research defining metrics to characterize password strength and using them to evaluate password-composition policies. In this paper, we analyze 12,000 passwords collected under seven composition policies via an online study. We develop an efficient distributed method for calculating how effectively several heuristic password-guessing algorithms guess passwords. Leveraging this method, we investigate (a) the resistance of passwords created under different conditions to guessing, (b) the performance of guessing algorithms under different training sets, (c) the relationship between passwords explicitly created under a given composition policy and other passwords that happen to meet the same requirements, and (d) the relationship between guess ability, as measured with password-cracking algorithms, and entropy estimates. Our findings advance understanding of both password-composition policies and metrics for quantifying password security.},

This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23{\%} of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40{\%} of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},

To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites.

In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adop- tion for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must of- fer RPs sucient business incentives and trustworthy iden- tity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks.

Results indicate that the mirror does manipulate, and the private subscale of the SCS does measure, self-attention. Exp II, with 81 female undergraduates, was a replication of the 1st study, but using an audience instead of a mirror. Results indicate that audience presence also heightens self-attention.

We designed a new SSL warning based on recommendations from warning literature and tested our proposal with microsurveys and a field experiment. We ultimately failed at our goal of a well-understood warning. However, nearly 30{\%} more total users chose to remain safe after seeing our warning. We attribute this success to opinionated design, which promotes safety with visual cues. Subsequently, our proposal was released as the new Google Chrome SSL warning. We raise questions about warning comprehension advice and recommend that other warning designers use opinionated design.},

@inproceedings{Hayashi2008UseYourIllusion,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose and evaluate Use Your Illusion, a novel mechanism for user authentication that is secure and usable regardless of the size of the device on which it is used. Our system relies on the human ability to recognize a degraded version of a previously seen image. We illustrate how distorted images can be used to maintain the usability of graphical password schemes while making them more resilient to social engineering or observation attacks. Because it is difficult to mentally “revert” a degraded image, without knowledge of the original image, our scheme provides a strong line of defense against impostor access, while preserving the desirable memorability properties of graphical password schemes. Using low-fidelity tests to aid in the design, we implement prototypes of Use Your Illusion as i) an Ajax-based web service and ii) on Nokia N70 cellular phones. We conduct a between-subjects usability study of the cellular phone prototype with a total of 99 participants in two experiments. We demonstrate that, regardless of their age or gender, users are very skilled at recognizing degraded versions of self-chosen images, even on small displays and after time periods of one month. Our results indicate that graphical passwords with distorted images can achieve equivalent error rates to those using traditional images, but only when the original image is known.},

@misc{Acar2016NotYourDeveloper,
abstract = {While researchers have developed many tools, techniques, and protocols for improving software security, exploits and breaches are only becoming more frequent. Some of this gap between theoretical security and actual vulnerability can be explained by insufficient consideration of human factors, broadly termed usability, when developing these mechanisms. In particular, security mechanisms may be difficult to use, may conflict with other priorities, or may assume more security knowledge than users possess. For almost 20 years, the usable security community has investigated how to improve the usability of security tools and interfaces aimed at end users. More recently, the community has begun to apply similar techniques in the context of improving security tools - such as APIs and bug-finding software - aimed not at end users but at developers, whose security errors are magnified across all users of their products. In this paper, we review key lessons learned from usable security for end users and consider how to apply them in the context of developers. We propose a research agenda aimed at developing a high-quality, comprehensive literature for usable security for developers, including: investigating how to conduct reliable research in this context, understanding developers' attitudes, knowledge, and priorities, measuring the status quo, and developing improved tools and interventions in the future.},

An exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors of Internet services: social services; information services; and leisure services. Extraversion and neuroticism showed different patterns of relationships with the factors of the Internet-Services Scale, with different patterns of association for men and women. For men, extraversion was positively related to the use of leisure services and neuroticism was negatively related to information services, whereas for women, extraversion was negatively related and neuroticism positively related to the use of social services. Implications for the study of the psychological influences of the Internet are discussed.},

There currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has increased. In this paper we release emoji2vec, pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emoji which are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing applications alongside word2vec. We demonstrate, for the downstream task of sentiment analysis, that emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in which emoji need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation.},

abstract = {Graphical password schemes have been proposed as an alternative to text passwords in applications that support graphics and mouse or stylus entry. In this paper we detail what is, to our knowledge, the largest published empirical evaluation of the effects of user choice on the security of graphical password schemes. We show that permitting user selection of passwords in two graphical password schemes, one based directly on an existing commercial product, can yield passwords with entropy far below the theoretical optimum and, in some cases, that are highly correlated with the race or gender of the user. For one scheme, this effect is so dramatic so as to render the scheme insecure. A conclusion of our work is that graphical password schemes of the type we study may generally require a different posture toward password selection than text passwords, where selection by the user remains the norm today.},

When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

Across all groups, we found that picture-in-picture attacks showing a fake browser window were as effective as the best other phishing technique, the homograph attack. Extended validation did not help users identify either attack. Additionally, reading the help file made users more likely to classify both real and fake web sites as legitimate when the phishing warning did not appear.},

@article{Halevi2015SpearPhishing,
abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks. In this study a real-world spear-phishing attack was performed on employees in organizational settings in order to examine how users' personality, attitudinal and perceived efficacy factors affect their tendency to expose themselves to such an attack. Spear-phishing attacks are more sophisticated than regular phishing attacks as they use personal information about their intended victim and present a stronger challenge for detection by both the potential victims as well as email phishing filters.While previous research showed that certain phishing attacks can lure a higher response rate from people with a higher level of the personality trait of Neuroticism, other traits were not explored in this context. The present study included a field-experiment which revealed a number of factors that increase the likelihood of users falling for a phishing attack: the factor that was found to be most correlated to the phishing response was users' Conscientiousness personality trait. The study also found gender-based difference in the response, with women more likely to respond to a spear-phishing message than men. In addition, this work detected negative correlation between the participants subjective estimate of their own vulnerability to phishing attacks and the likelihood that they will be phished. Put together, the finding suggests that vulnerability to phishing is in part a function of users' personality and that vulnerability is not due to lack of awareness of phishing risks. This implies that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by the users themselves, and that a targeted approach to defense may increase security effectiveness.},

@unpublished{Sasse2005UsabilityTrust,
abstract = {The need for people to protect themselves and their assets is as old as humankind. People's physical safety and their possessions have always been at risk from deliberate attack or accidental damage. The advance of information technology means that many individuals, as well as corporations, have an additional range of physical (equipment) and electronic (data) assets that are at risk. Furthermore, the increased number and types of interactions in cyberspace has enabled new forms of attack on people and their possessions. Consider grooming of minors in chat-rooms, or Nigerian email cons: minors were targeted by paedophiles before the creation of chat-rooms, and Nigerian criminals sent the same letters by physical mail or fax before there was email. But the technology has decreased the cost of many types of attacks, or the degree of risk for the attackers. At the same time, cyberspace is still new to many people, which means they do not understand risks, or recognise the signs of an attack, as readily as they might in the physical world. The IT industry has developed a plethora of security mechanisms, which could be used to mitigate risks or make attacks significantly more difficult. Currently, many people are either not aware of these mechanisms, or are unable or unwilling or to use them. Security experts have taken to portraying people as "the weakest link" in their efforts to deploy effective security [e.g. Schneier, 2000]. However, recent research has revealed at least some of the problem may be that security mechanisms are hard to use, or be ineffective. The review summarises current research on the usability of security mechanisms, and discusses options for increasing their usability and effectiveness.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

abstract = {Anecdotal evidence and scholarly research have shown that Internet users may regret some of their online disclosures. To help individuals avoid such regrets, we designed two modi- fications to the Facebook web interface that nudge users to consider the content and audience of their online disclosures more carefully. We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants' interactions with the nudges, the con- tent of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; how- ever, introducing a time delay before publishing users' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying. On bal- ance, some participants found the nudges helpful while oth- ers found them unnecessary or overly intrusive. We discuss implications and challenges for designing and evaluating sys- tems to assist users with online disclosures.},

@inproceedings{Chiasson2006PasswordManagers,
abstract = {We present a usability study of two recent password manager proposals: PwdHash (Ross et al., 2005) and Password Multiplier (Halderman et al., 2005). Both papers considered usability issues in greater than typical detail, the former briefly reporting on a small usability study; both also provided implementations for download. Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

abstract = {Password patterns, as used on current Android phones, and other shape-based authentication schemes are highly usable and memorable. In terms of security, they are rather weak since the shapes are easy to steal and reproduce. In this work, we introduce an implicit authentication approach that en-hances password patterns with an additional security layer, transparent to the user. In short, users are not only authenti-cated by the shape they input but also by the way they per-form the input. We conducted two consecutive studies, a lab and a long-term study, using Android applications to collect and log data from user input on a touch screen of standard commercial smartphones. Analyses using dynamic time warping (DTW) provided first proof that it is actually possi-ble to distinguish different users and use this information to increase security of the input while keeping the convenience for the user high.},

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.},

@article{Florencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom,
abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

abstract = {This paper discusses how persuasive technologies can be made adaptive to users. We present persuasion profiling as a method to personalize the persuasive messages used by a system to influence its users. This type of personalization can be based on explicit measures of users' tendencies to comply to distinct persuasive strategies: measures based on standardized questionnaire scores of users. However, persuasion profiling can also be implemented using implicit, behavioral measures of user traits. We present three case studies involving the design, implementation, and field deployment of personalized persuasive technologies, and we detail four design requirements. In each case study we show how these design requirements are implemented. In the discussion we highlight avenues for future research in the field of adaptive persuasive technologies.},

@inproceedings{Egelman2010PleaseContinueToHold,
abstract = {We present the results of an experiment examining the extent to which individuals will tolerate delays when told that such delays are for security purposes. In our experiment, we asked 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk users to count the total number of times a certain term was repeated in a multi-page document. The task was designed to be conducive to cheating. We assigned subjects to four between-subjects conditions: one of these offered a concrete security reason (virus-scanning) for the delay, another offered only a vague security explanation, another did not mention security at all, and a control condition without a delay. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to cheat or abandon the task when provided no explanation or a vague security explanation for the delay. However, when subjects were provided more explanation about the threat model and the protection ensured by the delay, they were not more likely to cheat than subjects in the control condition who faced no such delay. Our results thus contribute to the nascent literature on soft paternalistic solutions to security and privacy problems by suggesting that, when security mitigations cannot be made “free” for users, designers may incentivize compliant users' behavior by intentionally drawing attention to the mitigation itself.},

@article{Tversky1973,
abstract = {This paper explores a judgmental heuristic in which a person evaluates the frequency of classes or the probability of events by availability, i.e., by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind. In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Florencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom,
abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

abstract = {Much has changed since the first EDITION of humancomputer interaction was published. Ubiquitous computing and rich sensor-filled environments are finding their way out of the laboratory, not just into movies but also into our workplaces and homes. The computer has broken out of its plastic and glass bounds providing us with networked societies where personal computing devices from mobile phones to smart cards fill our pockets and electronic devices surround us at home and work. The web too has grown from a largely academic network into the hub of business and everyday lives. As the distinctions between the physical and the digital, and between work and leisure start to break down, human-computer interaction is also changing radically. The excitement of these changes is captured in this new EDITION, which also looks forward to other emerging technologies. However, the book is firmly rooted in strong principles and models indepENDent of the passing technologies of the day: these foundations will be the means by which today's students will understand tomorrow's technology. The third EDITION of humancomputer interaction can be used for introductory and advanced courses on HCI, Interaction Design, Usability or Interactive Systems Design. It will also prove an invaluable reference for professionals wishing to design usable computing devices. Accompanying the text is a comprehensive website containing a broad range of material for instructors, students and practitioners, a full text search facility for the book, links to many sites of additional interest and much more: go to www.hcibook.com New to this EDITION: bull; bull;A revised structure, reflecting the growth of HCI as a discipline, separates out basic material suitable for introductory courses from more detailed models and theories. bull;New chapter on Interaction Design adds material on scenarios and basic navigation design. bull;New chapter on Universal Design, substantially extENDing the coverage of this material in the book. bull;Updated and extENDed treatment of socio/contextual issues. bull;ExtENDed and new material on novel interaction, including updated ubicomp material, designing experience, physical sensors and a new chapter on rich interaction. bull;Updated material on the web including dynamic content and WAP.

@article{Proctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions,
abstract = {Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks as well as affect user behavior on social networks. This study examines the correlation between the Big Five personality traits and email phishing response. Another aspect examined is how these factors relate to users' tendency to share information and protect their privacy on Facebook (which is one of the most popular social networking sites). This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users. The goal of this study is to better understand the traits that contribute to online vulnerability, for the purpose of developing customized user interfaces and secure awareness education, designed to increase users' privacy and security in the future.},

We asked subjects to construct passwords for websites at both levels. Leveraging the lower-level passwords along with a dictionary attack, we successfully cracked almost one-third of the subjects' higher-level passwords. In a survey, subjects reported frequently reusing higher-level passwords, with or without modifications, as well as using a similar process to construct both levels of passwords.

Contrary to the assumption underlying the fundamental attribution error, the imputation of dispositional characteristics to individuals may be both logically and empirically tenable.

At present, evidence regarding a pronounced tendency to make attributions to situational factors may just as likely represent a fundamental error as it does a strong tendency to make attributions to dispositional characteristics.

@inproceedings{Fahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy,
abstract = {The ecological validity of password studies is a complex topic and difficult to quantify. Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

abstract = {Users tend to create passwords that are easy to guess, while system- assigned passwords tend to be hard to remember. Passphrases, space-delimited sets of natural language words, have been sug- gested as both secure and usable for decades. In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3- and 4-word system- assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system- assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

abstract = {Context-sensitive guidance (CSG) can help users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask the user to provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security dialogs irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic dialogs continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. Audited dialogs thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic dialogs. Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited dialogs. In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional dialogs. Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of organizations allowing per- sonal smart phones onto their networks, considerable secu- rity risk is introduced. The security risk is exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices and their respective installed pool of applications. Further- more, by virtue of the devices not being owned by the orga- nization, the ability to authoritatively enforce organizational security polices is challenging. As a result, a critical part of organizational security is the ability to drive user security behavior through either on-device mechanisms or security awareness programs. In this paper, we establish a base- line for user security behavior from a population of over one hundred fifty smart phone users. We then systematically evaluate the ability to drive behavioral change via messag- ing centered on morality, deterrence, and incentives. Our findings suggest that appeals to morality are most effective over time, whereas deterrence produces the most immediate reaction. Additionally, our findings show that while a sig- nificant portion of users are securing their devices without prior intervention, it is difficult to influence change in those who do not.},

Nowadays, mobile devices can work as flexible tools to create reference points thus supporting decisions without being explicit about it. We discuss if and how mobile apps can influence decision making. As a consequence, apps can be built to better fit into the decision making progress.

abstract = {Despite their ubiquity, many password meters provide inac-curate strength estimates. Furthermore, they do not explain to users what is wrong with their password or how to im-prove it. We describe the development and evaluation of a data-driven password meter that provides accurate strength measurement and actionable, detailed feedback to users. This meter combines neural networks and numerous carefully com-bined heuristics to score passwords and generate data-driven text feedback about the user's password. We describe the meter's iterative development and final design. We detail the security and usability impact of the meter's design dimensions, examined through a 4,509-participant online study. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we found that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback led users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator.},

abstract = {We present the results of an experiment examining the extent to which individuals will tolerate delays when told that such delays are for security purposes. In our experiment, we asked 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk users to count the total number of times a certain term was repeated in a multi-page document. The task was designed to be conducive to cheating. We assigned subjects to four between-subjects conditions: one of these offered a concrete security reason (virus-scanning) for the delay, another offered only a vague security explanation, another did not mention security at all, and a control condition without a delay. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to cheat or abandon the task when provided no explanation or a vague security explanation for the delay. However, when subjects were provided more explanation about the threat model and the protection ensured by the delay, they were not more likely to cheat than subjects in the control condition who faced no such delay. Our results thus contribute to the nascent literature on soft paternalistic solutions to security and privacy problems by suggesting that, when security mitigations cannot be made “free” for users, designers may incentivize compliant users' behavior by intentionally drawing attention to the mitigation itself.},

abstract = {Automated teller machine (ATM) frauds are increasing drastically these days. When analyzing the most common attacks and the reasons for successful frauds, it becomes apparent that the main problem lies in the PIN based authentication which in itself does not provide any security features (besides the use of asterisks). That is, security is solely based on a user's behavior. Indirect input is one way to solve this problem. This mostly comes at the costs of adding overhead to the input process. We present ColorPIN, an authentication mechanism that uses indirect input to provide security enhanced PIN entry. At the same time, ColorPIN remains a one-to-one relationship between the length of the PIN and the required number of clicks. A user study showed that ColorPIN is significantly more secure than standard PIN entry while enabling good authentication speed in comparison with related systems.},

PSV can be seen as a reconfigurable " box " containing different proactive password checkers (PPCs) and visualizers of password security information, allowing it to be used like a " many in one " or " hy-brid " PPC. PSV can provide many new features that do not exist in traditional PPCs, thus having a greater potential to achieve its goals of educating users. Using purely client-side Web-based technologies, we implemented a prototype of PSV as an open-source software tool on a 2-D animated canvas. To evaluate the actual performance of our imple-mented PSV prototype against traditional PPCs, we conducted a semi-structured interview involving 20 human participants. Our qualitative analysis of the results showed that PSV was considered the most in-formative and recommended by most participants as a good educational tool. To the best of our knowledge, PSV is the first system combining dif-ferent PPCs together for user education, and the user study is the first of this kind on comparing educational effectiveness of different PPCs (and PPC-like password security tools such as PSV).},

abstract = {Password-composition policies are intended to increase resistance to guessing attacks by requiring certain features (e.g., a minimum length and the inclusion of a digit). Sadly, they often result in users' passwords exhibiting new, yet still predictable, patterns. In this paper, we investigate the usability and security of adaptive password-composition policies, which dynamically change password requirements over time as users create new passwords. We conduct a 2,619- participant between-subjects online experiment to evaluate the strength and usability of passwords created with two adaptive password policies. We also design and test a feedback system that guides users to successfully create a password conforming to these policies. We find that a wellconfigured, structure-based adaptive password policy can significantly increase password strength with little to no decrease in usability. We discuss how system administrators can use these results to improve password diversity.},

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2010PasswordThicket,
abstract = {We report the results of the first large-scale empirical analysis of password implementations deployed on the Internet. Our study included 150 websites which offer free user accounts for a variety of purposes, including the most popular destinations on the web and a random sample of e-commerce, news, and communication websites. Although all sites evaluated relied on user-chosen textual passwords for authentication, we found many subtle but important technical variations in im- plementation with important security implications. Many poor practices were commonplace, such as a lack of encryption to protect transmitted passwords, storage of cleartext passwords in server databases, and little protection of passwords from brute force attacks. While a spectrum of imple- mentation quality exists with a general co-occurrence of more-secure and less-secure implementa- tion choices, we find a surprising number of inconsistent choices within individual sites, suggesting that the lack of a standards is harming security. We observe numerous ways in which the technical failures of lower-security sites can compromise higher-security sites due to the well-established ten- dency of users to re-use passwords. Our data confirms that the worst security practices are indeed found at sites with few security incentives, such as newspaper websites, while sites storing more sensitive information such as payment details or user communication implement more password se- curity. From an economic viewpoint, password insecurity is a negative externality that the market has been unable to correct, undermining the viability of password-based authentication. We also speculate that some sites deploying passwords do so primarily for psychological reasons, both as a justification for collecting marketing data and as a way to build trusted relationships with customers. This theory suggests that efforts to replace passwords with more-secure protocols or federated iden- tity systems may fail because they dont recreate the entrenched ritual of password authentication.},

The theory is based on ideas of dominance seeking, in which the decision maker actively looks for ways to simplify the task. Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

These placebo effects stem from activation of expectancies about the efficacy of the product, a process that appears not to be conscious. In three experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity) may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product (e.g., they are able to solve fewer puzzles) than consumers who purchase and consume the exact same product but pay its regular price. The studies consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo effect.

Over the years, many attacks on HTTPS and the certificate trust model it uses have been hypothesized, executed, and/or evolved.

abstract = {The fact that a majority of Internet users appear unharmed each year is difficult to reconcile with a weakest-link analysis. We seek to explain this enormous gap between potential and actual harm. The answer, we find, lies in the fact that an Internet attacker, who attacks en masse, faces a sum-of-effort rather than a weakest-link defense. Large-scale attacks must be profitable in expectation, not merely in particular scenarios. For example, knowing the dog's name may open an occasional bank account, but the cost of determining one million users' dogs' names is far greater than that information is worth. The strategy that appears simple in isolation leads to bankruptcy in expectation. Many attacks cannot be made profitable, even when many profitable targets exist. We give several examples of insecure practices which should be exploited by a weakest-link attacker but are extremely difficult to turn into profitable attacks.},

@article{Kahneman2003MapsOfBoundedRationality,
abstract = {Economists often criticize psychological research for its propensity to generate lists of errors and biases, and for its failure to offer a coherent alternative to the rational-agent model. The present treatment distinguishes two modes of thinking and deciding, which correspond roughly to the everyday concepts of reasoning and intuition. In the examples discussed, intuition was associated with poor performance, but intuitive thinking can also be powerful and accurate. A defining property of intuitive thoughts is that they come to mind spontaneously, like percepts. The evaluation of stimuli as good or bad is a particularly important natural assessment. A general property of perceptual systems is that they are designed to enhance the accessibility of changes and differences. Perception is reference-dependent: the perceived attributes of a focal stimulus reflect the contrast between that stimulus and a context of prior and concurrent stimuli. The assumption that preferences are not affected by inconsequential variations in the description of outcomes has been called extensionality and invariance, and is considered an essential aspect of rationality.},

We used Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome's in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Fire- fox's malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google Chrome's malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox's SSL warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies acrosswarnings. In con- trast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2{\%} of Google Chrome's SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can have a significant impact on user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers.},

However, during our study we observed a strong disparity between our participants actions during the laboratory tasks and their self-reported "would be" actions during similar tasks in everyday computer practices. Our participants attributed this disparity to the laboratory environment and the security it offered. In this paper we discuss our results and how the introduced changes to the initial study design may have affected them. Also, we discuss the challenges of observing natural behavior in a study environment, as well as the challenges of replicating previous studies given the rapid changes in web technology. We also propose alternatives to traditional laboratory study methodologies that can be considered by the usable security research community when investigating research questions involving sensitive data where trust may influence behavior.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a controlled study with 2,482 participants who interpreted emoji both in isolation and in multiple textual contexts. After comparing the variability of emoji interpreta-tion in each condition, we found that our results do not sup-port the hypothesis in prior work: when emoji are interpreted in textual contexts, the potential for miscommunication ap-pears to be roughly the same. We also identify directions for future research to better understand the interplay between emoji and textual context.},

@inproceedings{Kroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication,
abstract = {The fields of security and usability often conflict with each other. Security focuses on making systems difficult for attackers to compromise. However, doing this also increases difficulty for the user. Users in security are often seen as an obstacle - they are the weakest point of the system, willing to circumvent security policies in order to access their work faster. A large part of security is authentication: knowing who a user of a system is and denying access to unauthenticated users. Authentication is very often the starting point of user interaction with security systems. Unfortunately, authentication is still most commonly achieved using text-based passwords. This is often the easiest and cheapest system to implement. Most websites and services advise users to select unique, complex and lengthy passwords. These passwords are difficult for users to remember and often lead to irresponsible behaviour such as writing down or reusing passwords. Serious games are games that are designed for a different primary purpose than pure entertainment. This field includes gamification, where non-gaming contexts are enhanced by using principles from gaming. Examples include experience points, achievements, progress indicators and leader boards. Gamification uses these tools to persuade users to change their behaviour. If gamification can be applied to security, it may aid in convincing users to act more securely. This paper discusses the possibilities of applying gamification to authentication as a new approach to usability and security.},

Using a set of novel psychology-informed indicators that can be computed from data available to all carriers, we were able to predict users' personality with a mean accuracy across traits of 42{\%} better than random, reaching up to 61{\%} accuracy on a three-class problem. Given the fast growing number of mobile phone subscription and availability of phone logs to researchers, our new personality indicators open the door to exciting av- enues for future research in social sciences. They potentially enable cost- effective, questionnaire-free investigation of personality-related questions at a scale never seen before.},

abstract = {Under certain circumstances, consumers are willing to pay a premium for privacy. We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users' stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

abstract = {Automation is the essence of MDD (Model-Driven Development). Transforming models into models following a set of rules is at the core of automation. It allows using tools to enliven processes that have been defined. Transition methods are most likely the most important player in the engineering of software. The 4SRS (Four Step Rule Set) is a transition method we adopt in this paper to focus the discussion on the transition from the analysis to the design of software. It has been formalized as a small software development process that can be plugged into larger software development processes. That formalization was conducted with the SPEM (Software {\&} Systems Process Engineering Metamodel), which is a process modeling language for the domain of software and systems. This paper exemplifies how a transition method like the 4SRS can be modeled with the SPEM as a way to study the benefits of the automatic or semiautomatic execution of a transition method as a small dedicated software development process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Amrutkar2013SecurityIndicatorsMobile,
abstract = {Mobile browsers are increasingly being relied upon to perform security sensitive operations. Like their desktop counterparts, these applications can enable SSL/TLS to provide strong security guarantees for communications over the web. However, the drastic reduction in screen size and the accompanying reorganization of screen real-estate significantly changes the use and consistency of the security indicators and certificate information that alert users of site identity and the presence of strong cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we perform the first measurement of the state of critical security indicators in mobile browsers. We evaluate ten mobile and two tablet browsers, representing over 90{\%} of the market share, against the recommended guidelines for web user interface to convey security set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). While desktop browsers follow the majority of guidelines, our analysis shows that mobile browsers fall significantly short. We also observe notable inconsistencies across mobile browsers when such mechanisms actually are implemented. We show where and how these failures on mobile browsers eliminate clues previously designed for, and still present in, desktop browsers to detect attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle. Finally, we offer advice on where current standards are unclear or incomplete.},

@article{Fagan2017UsersConsiderationsPWMs,
abstract = {Password managers, though commonly recommended by security experts, are still not used by many users. Understanding why some choose to use password managers while others do not is important towards generally understanding why some users do what they do and, by extension, designing motivational tools such as video tutorials to help motivate more to use password managers. To investigate differences between those who do and do not use a password manager, for this paper, we distributed an online survey to a total of 137 users and 111 non-users of the tool that asked about their opinions/experiences with password managers. Furthermore, since emotion has been identified by work in psychology and communications as influential in other risk- laden decision-making (e.g., safe-sex behavior such as condom use), we asked partici- pants who use a password manager to rate how they feel for 45 different emotions, or, as the case for those who do not use a password manager, to rate how they imagine they would feel the 45 emotions if they did use the tool. Our results show that “users” of password managers noted convenience and usefulness as the main reasons behind using the tool, rather than security gains, underscoring the fact that even a large por- tion of users of the tool are not considering security as the primary benefit while mak- ing the decision. On the other hand, “non-users” noted security concerns as the main reason for not using a password manager, highlighting the prevalence of suspicion arising from lack of understanding of the technology itself. Finally, analysis of the differ- ences in emotions between “users” and “non-users” reveals that participants who never use a password manager are more likely to feel suspicious compared to “users,” which could be due to misunderstandings about the tool.},

abstract = {A striking characteristic of human memory is that pictures are remembered better than words. We examined the neural correlates of memory for pictures and words in the context of episodic memory encoding to determine material-specific differences in brain activity patterns. To do this, we used positron emission tomography to map the brain regions active during encoding of words and pictures of objects. Encoding was carried out by using three different strategies to explore possible interactions between material specificity and types of processing. Encoding of pictures resulted in greater activity of bilateral visual and medial temporal cortices, compared with encoding words, whereas encoding of words was associated with increased activity in prefrontal and temporoparietal regions related to language function. Each encoding strategy was characterized by a distinctive activity pattern, but these patterns were largely the same for pictures and words. Thus, superior overall memory for pictures may be mediated by more effective and automatic engagement of areas important for visual memory, including medial temporal cortex, whereas the mechanisms underlying specific encoding strategies appear to operate similarly on pictures and words.},

We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users' stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

@inproceedings{Whitten1999WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt,
abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

We have developed Versipass, a password manager that incorporates key elements of password managers and cued graphical pass- words to avoid existing problems of password memorabil- ity and associating passwords with accounts. Instead of re- membering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better re- member their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.},

@inproceedings{Dhamija2005DynamicSecuritySkins,
abstract = {Phishing is a model problem for illustrating usability concerns of privacy and security because both system designers and attackers battle using user interfaces to guide (or misguide) users. We propose a new scheme, Dynamic Security Skins, that allows a remote web server to prove its identity in a way that is easy for a human user to verify and hard for an attacker to spoof. We describe the design of an extension to the Mozilla Firefox browser that implements this scheme. We present two novel interaction techniques to prevent spoofing. First, our browser extension provides a trusted window in the browser dedicated to username and password entry. We use a photographic image to create a trusted path between the user and this window to prevent spoofing of the window and of the text entry fields. Second, our scheme allows the remote server to generate a unique abstract image for each user and each transaction. This image creates a “skin” that automatically customizes the browser window or the user interface elements in the content of a remote web page. Our extension allows the user's browser to independently compute the image that it expects to receive from the server. To authenticate content from the server, the user can visually verify that the images match. We contrast our work with existing anti-phishing proposals. In contrast to other proposals, our scheme places a very low burden on the user in terms of effort, memory and time. To authenticate himself, the user has to recognize only one image and remember one low entropy password, no matter how many servers he wishes to interact with. To authenticate content from an authenticated server, the user only needs to perform one visual matching operation to compare two images. Furthermore, it places a high burden of effort on an attacker to spoof customized security indicators.},

An ideal SSL warning would empower users to make informed decisions and, failing that, guide confused users to safety. Unfortunately, users struggle to understand and often disregard real SSL warnings. We report on the task of designing a new SSL warning, with the goal of improving comprehension and adherence. We designed a new SSL warning based on recommendations from warning literature and tested our proposal with microsurveys and a field experiment. We ultimately failed at our goal of a well-understood warning. However, nearly 30{\%} more total users chose to remain safe after seeing our warning. We attribute this success to opinionated design, which promotes safety with visual cues. Subsequently, our proposal was released as the new Google Chrome SSL warning. We raise questions about warning comprehension advice and recommend that other warning designers use opinionated design.},

@inproceedings{Florencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom,
abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

@inproceedings{Forget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion,
abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

@inproceedings{Herley2009SoLongThanksExternalities,
abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100{\%} of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01{\%} of them a modest annual pain.},

@inproceedings{Maurer2011DataTypeWarnings,
abstract = {When browsing the Internet, users are likely to be exposed to security and privacy threats – like fraudulent websites. Automatic browser mechanisms can protect them only to some extent. In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better-that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited. Implications for future research are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2015SecretsLies,
abstract = {We examine the ﬁrst large real-world data set on personal knowl- edge question's security and memorability from their deployment at Google. Our analysis conﬁrms that secret questions generally offer a security level that is far lower than user-chosen passwords. It turns out to be even lower than proxies such as the real distribution of sur- names in the population would indicate. Surprisingly, we found that a signiﬁcant cause of this insecurity is that users often don't answer truthfully. A user survey we conducted revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of users (37{\%}) who admitted to providing fake answers did so in an attempt to make them "harder to guess" although on aggregate this behavior had the opposite effect as people "harden" their answers in a predictable way. On the usability side, we show that secret answers have sur- prisingly poor memorability despite the assumption that reliability motivates their continued deployment. From millions of account re- covery attempts we observed a signiﬁcant fraction of users (e.g 40{\%} of our English-speaking US users) were unable to recall their an- swers when needed. This is lower than the success rate of alternative recovery mechanisms such as SMS reset codes (over 80{\%}). Comparing question strength and memorability reveals that the questions that are potentially the most secure (e.g what is your ﬁrst phone number) are also the ones with the worst memorability. We conclude that it appears next to impossible to ﬁnd secret questions that are both secure and memorable. Secret questions continue have some use when combined with other signals, but they should not be used alone and best practice should favor more reliable alternatives.},

The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

@article{Gilbert1995CorrespondenceBias,
abstract = {The correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person's unique and enduring dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the situations in which they occur. Although this tendency is one of the most fundamental phenomena in social psychology, its causes and consequences remain poorly understood. This article sketches an intellectual history of the correspondence bias as an evolving problem in social psychology, describes 4 mechanisms (lack of awareness, unrealistic expectations, inflated categorizations, and incomplete corrections) that produce distinct forms of correspondence bias, and discusses how the consequences of correspon-dence-biased inferences may perpetuate such inferences. One will seldom go wrong if one attributes extreme actions to van-ity, average ones to habit, and petty ones to fear. (Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886/1984, p. 59) Despite the homilies of philosophers, no one has yet found a simple formula for understanding others. The problem, of course, is that a person's inner self is hidden from view. Charac-ter, motive, belief, desire, and intention play leading roles in people's construal of others, and yet none of these constructs can actually be observed. As such, people are forced into the difficult business of inferring these intangibles from that which is, in fact, observable: other people's words and deeds. When one infers the invisible from the visible, one risks making a mis-take. Three decades of research in social psychology have shown that many of the mistakes people make are of a kind: When people observe behavior, they often conclude that the person who performed the behavior was predisposed to do so—that the person's behavior corresponds to the person's unique disposi-tions—and they draw such conclusions even when a logical analysis suggests they should not. In this article, we describe the causes and consequences of this particular mistake, which we call the correspondence bias. We do not attempt a complete review of the voluminous litera-ture on this topic. Rather, we first define the correspondence},

abstract = {Challenging the conventional wisdom that users cannot remember cryptographically-strong secrets, we test the hypothesis that users can learn randomly-assigned 56- bit codes (encoded as either 6 words or 12 characters) through spaced repetition. We asked remote research participants to perform a distractor task that required log- ging into a website 90 times, over up to two weeks, with a password of their choosing. After they entered their chosen password correctly we displayed a short code (4 letters or 2 words, 18.8 bits) that we required them to type. For subsequent logins we added an increasing de- lay prior to displaying the code, which participants could avoid by typing the code from memory. As participants learned, we added two more codes to comprise a 56.4- bit secret. Overall, 94{\%} of participants eventually typed their entire secret from memory, learning it after a me- dian of 36 logins. The learning component of our system added a median delay of just 6.9 s per login and a to- tal of less than 12 minutes over an average of ten days. 88{\%} were able to recall their codes exactly when asked at least three days later, with only 21{\%} reporting having written their secret down. As one participant wrote with surprise, “the words are branded into my brain.” While our study is preliminary in nature, we believe it debunks the myth that users are inherently incapable of remem- bering cryptographically-strong secrets for a select few high-stakes scenarios, such as a password for enterprise login or as a master key to protect other credentials (e.g., in a password manager).},

Various anti-phishing techniques attempt to mitigate such attacks. Domain highlighting is one such approach recently incorporated by several popular web browsers. The idea is simple: the domain name of an address is highlighted in the address bar, so that users can inspect it to determine a web site's legitimacy. Our research asks a basic question: how well does domain highlighting work? To answer this, we showed 22 participants 16 web pages typical of those targeted for phishing attacks, where participants had to determine the page's legitimacy. In the first round, they judged the page's legitimacy by whatever means they chose. In the second round, they were directed specifically to look at the address bar. We found that participants fell into 3 types in terms of how they determined the legitimacy of a web page; while domain highlighting was somewhat effective for one user type, it was much less effective for others. We conclude that domain highlighting, while providing some benefit, cannot be relied upon as the sole method to prevent phishing attacks.},

@inproceedings{Fahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy,
abstract = {The ecological validity of password studies is a complex topic and difficult to quantify. Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

abstract = {Security experts frequently refer to people as “the weakest link in the chain” of system security. Famed hacker Kevin Mitnick revealed that he hardly ever cracked a password, because it “was easier to dupe people into revealing it” by employing a range of social engineering techniques. Often, such failures are attributed to users' carelessness and ignorance. However, more enlightened researchers have pointed out that current security tools are simply too complex for many users, and they have made efforts to improve user interfaces to security tools. In this chapter, we aim to broaden the current perspective, focusing on the usability of security tools (or products) and the process of designing secure systems for the real-world context (the panorama) in which they have to operate. Here we demonstrate how current human factors knowledge and user-centered design principles can help security designers produce security solutions that are effective in practice.},

@inproceedings{Forget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion,
abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23{\%} of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40{\%} of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},

@inproceedings{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp,
abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

abstract = {OpenID and InfoCard are two mainstream Web single sign- on (SSO) solutions intended for Internet-scale adoption. While they are technically sound, the business model of these solu- tions does not provide content-hosting and service providers (CSPs) with sucient incentives to become relying parties (RPs). In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adop- tion for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must of- fer RPs sucient business incentives and trustworthy iden- tity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks. Moreover, we propose that Web SSO technol- ogy should build identity support into browsers in order to facilitate RPs' adoption.},

An attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the individual's authentication session. This is referred to as shoulder-surfing and is a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. Until recently, the only defense against shoulder-surfing has been vigilance on the part of the user. This paper reports on the design and evaluation of a game-like graphical method of authentication that is resistant to shoulder-surfing. The Convex Hull Click (CHC) scheme allows a user to prove knowledge of the graphical password safely in an insecure location because users never have to click directly on their password images. Usability testing of the CHC scheme showed that novice users were able to enter their graphical password accurately and to remember it over time. However, the protection against shoulder-surfing comes at the price of longer time to carry out the authentication.},

abstract = {Multiple studies have demonstrated that users select weak passwords. However, the vast majority of studies on password security uses password lists that only have passwords for one site, which means that several important questions cannot be studied. For example, how much stronger are password choices for different categories of sites? We use a dataset which we extracted from a large dump of malware records. It contains multiple accounts (and passwords) per user and thus allows us to study both password re-use and the correlation between the value of an account and the strength of the passwords for those accounts. The first contribution of our study shows that users in our sample choose (substantially) stronger passwords for financial accounts than for low- value accounts, based on the extracted passwords as well as publicly available lists. This contribution has implications for password research, as some widely-used lists contain passwords much weaker than those used in the real world (for accounts of more than low value). In our second contribution, we measure password re-use taking account values into account. We see that although high-value passwords are stronger, they are re-used more frequently than low-value passwords – valuable passwords are identical to 21{\%} of the remaining passwords of a user. Before our study, little was known about password re-use for different account values.},

First, our browser extension provides a trusted window in the browser dedicated to username and password entry. We use a photographic image to create a trusted path between the user and this window to prevent spoofing of the window and of the text entry fields. Second, our scheme allows the remote server to generate a unique abstract image for each user and each transaction. This image creates a “skin” that automatically customizes the browser window or the user interface elements in the content of a remote web page. Our extension allows the user's browser to independently compute the image that it expects to receive from the server. To authenticate content from the server, the user can visually verify that the images match. We contrast our work with existing anti-phishing proposals. In contrast to other proposals, our scheme places a very low burden on the user in terms of effort, memory and time. To authenticate himself, the user has to recognize only one image and remember one low entropy password, no matter how many servers he wishes to interact with. To authenticate content from an authenticated server, the user only needs to perform one visual matching operation to compare two images. Furthermore, it places a high burden of effort on an attacker to spoof customized security indicators.},

abstract = {How people intentionally change addictive behaviors with and without treatment is not well understood by behavioral scientists. This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

@article{DeAngeli2005PictureThousandWords,
abstract = {The weakness of knowledge-based authentication systems, such as passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), is well known, and reflects an uneasy compromise between security and human memory constraints. Research has been undertaken for some years now into the feasibility of graphical authentication mechanisms in the hope that these will provide a more secure and memorable alternative. The graphical approach substitutes the exact recall of alphanumeric codes with the recognition of previously learnt pictures, a skill at which humans are remarkably proficient. So far, little attention has been devoted to usability, and initial research has failed to conclusively establish significant memory improvement. This paper reports two user studies comparing several implementations of the graphical approach with PINs. Results demonstrate that pictures can be a solution to some problems relating to traditional knowledge-based authentication but that they are not a simple panacea, since a poor design can eliminate the picture superiority effect in memory. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of the graphical approach and providing guidelines for developers contemplating using these mechanisms. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The ecological validity of password studies is a complex topic and difficult to quantify. Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better-that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited. Implications for future research are discussed.},

Additionally, an extended literature review about password habits and effectiveness regarding length and complexity is included.

Users often do not understand enough about the impact of a security decision to make an informed choice. We report on the experience in a 500-person organization on the security of each user's Lotus Notes client against unsigned active content.

abstract = {Emojis have been widely used to simplify emotional expression and enrich user experience. As an interesting practice of ubiquitous computing, emojis are adopted by Internet users from many different countries, on many devices (particularly popular on smartphones), and in many applications. The "ubiquitous" usage of emojis enables us to study and compare user behaviors and preferences across countries and cultures. We present an analysis on how smartphone users use emojis based on a very large data set collected from a popular emoji keyboard. The data set contains a complete month of emoji usage of 3.88 million active users from 212 countries and regions. We demonstrate that the categories and frequencies of emojis used by these users provide rich signals for the identification and the understanding of cultural differences of smartphone users. Users from different countries present significantly different preferences on emojis, which complies with the well-known Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.},

@article{Wood2007,
abstract = {The present model outlines the mechanisms underlying habitual control of responding and the ways in which habits interface with goals. Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between responses and the features of performance contexts that have historically covaried with them (e.g., physical settings, preceding actions). Once a habit is formed, perception of contexts triggers the associated response without a mediating goal. Nonetheless, habits interface with goals. Constraining this interface, habit associations accrue slowly and do not shift appreciably with current goal states or infrequent counterhabitual responses. Given these constraints, goals can (a) direct habits by motivating repetition that leads to habit formation and by promoting exposure to cues that trigger habits, (b) be inferred from habits, and (c) interact with habits in ways that preserve the learned habit associations. Finally, the authors outline the implications of the model for habit change, especially for the self-regulation of habit cuing.},

Only in recent years has the security research community acknowledged that user behavior plays a part in many security failures, and that policies alone may not be sufficient to ensure correct behavior. We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind. We present the results of a first study that can guide such persuasive efforts, and describe methods that can be used to persuade users to employ proper password practice.},

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

All common mobile platforms and many desktop systems now support emoji entry and users have embraced their use. Yet, we currently know very little about what makes for good emoji entry. While soft keyboards for text entry are well optimized, based on language and touch models, no such information exists to guide the design of emoji keyboards. In this article, we investigate of the problem of emoji entry, starting with a study of the current state of the emoji keyboard implementation in Android. To enable moving forward to novel emoji keyboard designs, we then explore a model for emoji similarity that is able to inform such designs. This semantic model is based on data from 21 million collected tweets containing emoji. We compare this model against a solely description-based model of emoji in a crowdsourced study. Our model shows good performance in capturing detailed relationships between emoji.},

@inproceedings{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp,
abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

@inproceedings{Inglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies,
abstract = {HCI research published 10 years ago pointed out that many users cannot cope with the number and complexity of passwords, and resort to insecure workarounds as a consequence. We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

A theory of dynamic choice reconstruction is presented to account for this effect. The theory is based on ideas of dominance seeking, in which the decision maker actively looks for ways to simplify the task. Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

@article{Edwards2008,
abstract = {End-users are often perceived as the weakest link in information security. Because of this perception, a growing body of research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea for end-user information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security for end-users. We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions for end-users.},

The latest Global Phishing Survey, published by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), has new data that shows where phishing has been taking place, and in some cases how and why. The report indicates that, through the later part of 2009, a single gang of phishers - the 'Avalanche' operation - was responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks launched on the Internet. Greg Aaron, a director at Afilias, analyses the activities of the Avalanche group and asks what they tell us about the state of phishing today. Famous old-time bank robber Willie Sutton said, "Go where the money is ... and go there often". And that's what today's e-criminals are doing - they're going where the money is, and with startling frequency. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

We implemented and evaluated these two nudges in a 6-week field trial with 28 Facebook users. We analyzed participants' interactions with the nudges, the con- tent of their posts, and opinions collected through surveys. We found that reminders about the audience of posts can prevent unintended disclosures without major burden; how- ever, introducing a time delay before publishing users' posts can be perceived as both beneficial and annoying. On bal- ance, some participants found the nudges helpful while oth- ers found them unnecessary or overly intrusive.

@article{Jenkins2014a,
abstract = {Password reuse-using the same password for multiple accounts-is a prevalent phenomenon that can make even the most secure systems vulnerable. When passwords are reused across multiple systems, hackers may compromise accounts by stealing passwords from low-security sites to access sites with higher security. Password reuse can be particularly threatening to users in developing countries in which cyber-security training is limited, law enforcement of cyber-security is non-existent, or in which programs to secure cyberspace are limited. This article proposes a two-pronged solution for reducing password reuse through detection and mitigation. First, based on the theories of routine, cognitive load, and motor movement, we hypothesize that password reuse can be detected by monitoring characteristics of users' typing behavior (i.e., keystroke dynamics). Second, based on protection motivation theory, we hypothesize that providing just-in-time fear appeals when a violation is detected will decrease password reuse. We tested our hypotheses in an experiment and found that users' keystroke dynamics are diagnostic of password reuse. By analyzing changes in typing patterns, we were able to detect password reuse with 81.71{\%} accuracy. We also found that just-in-time fear appeals decrease password reuse; 88.41{\%} of users who received a fear appeal subsequently created unique passwords, whereas only 4.45{\%} of users who did not receive a fear appeal created unique passwords. Our results suggest that future research should continue to examine keystroke dynamics as an indicator of cyber-security behaviors, and use just-in-time fear appeals as a method for reducing non-secure behavior. The findings of our research provide a practical and cost-effective solution to bolster cyber-security through discouraging password reuse.

While these warn- ings often appear in benign situations, they can also signal a man-in-the-middle attack. We conducted a survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their reactions to and understanding of current SSL warn- ings. We then designed two new warnings using warn- ings science principles and lessons learned from the survey. We evaluated warnings used in three pop- ular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100- participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our warnings performed significantly better than exist- ing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our re- sults suggest that, while warnings can be improved, a better approach may be to minimize the use of SSL warnings altogether by blocking users from making unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in be- nign situations.},

@article{Kumaraguru2010TeachingJohnny,
abstract = {Phishing attacks, in which criminals lure Internet users to Web sites that spoof legitimate Web sites, are occurring with increasing frequency and are causing considerable harm to victims. While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks. Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called “PhishGuru” and an online game called “Anti-Phishing Phil” that teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.},

abstract = {There has been a loss of confidence in the security provided by SSL certificates and browser interfaces in the face of var- ious attacks. As one response, basic SSL server certificates are being demoted to second-class status in conjunction with the introduction of Extended Validation (EV) SSL certifi- cates. Unfortunately, EV SSL certificates may complicate the already difficult design challenge of effectively convey- ing certificate information to the average user. This study explores the interfaces related to SSL certificates in the most widely deployed browser (Internet Explorer 7), proposes an alternative set of interface dialogs, and compares their effec- tiveness through a user study involving 40 participants. The alternative interface was found to offer statistically signifi- cant improvements in confidence, ease of finding informa- tion, and ease of understanding. Such results from a modest re-design effort suggest considerable room for improvement in the user interfaces of browsers today. This work moti- vates further study of whether EV SSL certificates offer a robust foundation for improving Internet trust, or a further compromise to usable security for ordinary users.},

Passphrases, space-delimited sets of natural language words, have been sug- gested as both secure and usable for decades. In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3- and 4-word system- assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system- assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

Science is a collective and cumulative enterprise, so to be qualified as usable, statistical tools should support and promote clear thinking as well as clear and truthful communication. Yet areas such as human-computer interaction (HCI) have adopted tools – i.e., p-values and statistical significance testing – that have proven to be quite poor at supporting these tasks. The use and misuse of p-values and significance testing has been severely criticized in a range of disciplines for several decades, suggesting that tools should be blamed, not end users. This article explains why it would be beneficial for HCI to switch from statis- tical significance testing to estimation, i.e., reporting informative charts with effect sizes and confidence intervals, and offering nuanced interpretations of our results. Advice is offered on how to communicate our empirical results in a clear, accurate, and transparent way without using any p-value. Key-words:},

Even if only temporarily in the hands of non-entitled persons, privacy is at stake. Authentication protects against unauthorized usage. Today's operating systems of mobile devices offer authentication mechanisms. However, they are either vulnerable in some situations or not user friendly enough to be widely adopted. In this paper we suggest a novel authentication system which meets both the requirements of security and usability. For that purpose, we have analyzed existing authentication methods as well as targeting attacks. The resulting Android application SecureLock is a generic authentication system, which offers PIN and password, but also a property-based authentication method by means of NFC tags, and a novel image-based method called GesturePuzzle. The application has been evaluated and compared with other approaches for security and usability.},

abstract = {We find that traditional password advice given to users is somewhat dated. Strong passwords do nothing to protect online users from password stealing attacks such as phishing and keylogging, and yet they place considerable burden on users. Passwords that are too weak of course invite brute-force attacks. However, we find that relatively weak passwords, about 20 bits or so, are sufficient to make brute-force attacks on a single account unrealistic so long as a "three strikes" type rule is in place. Above that minimum it appears that increasing password strength does little to address any real threat. If a larger credential space is needed it appears better to increase the strength of the userID's rather than the passwords. For large institutions this is just as effective in deterring bulk guessing attacks and is a great deal better for users. For small institutions there appears little reason to require strong passwords for online accounts.},

@article{Gulenko2014PasswordsEmotion,
abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to study the influence of emotions on security behaviour by reviewing Information Systems Security (ISS) topics in Information Systems (IS) literature. Researchers in ISS study how to motivate people to adhere to security policies; they mainly focus on cognitive models such as the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1985), innovation diffusion theory (Brancheau and Wetherbe, 1990), theory of planned behaviour (Mathieson, 1991) and social cognitive theory (Compeau and Higgins, 1995). Applying positive emotions such as joy and interest is feasible by adding emoticons and positive messages; we use this approach to improve password choosing. Design/methodology/approach – We apply differential emotional theory (Izard 2002) from psychology to the context of ISS. Twenty-two participants took part in an experiment with the task of choosing strong but memorable passphrases. The dependent variable is the strength of the chosen passphrase. The task for the user is to come up with a passphrase that is both strong and memorable. We choose a between-subject design. The independent variable is the emotional interface that the user is confronted with. Findings – We found that 5.35 words was the mean when participants were shown positive smiley faces and messages. When exposed to negative emoticons, the mean was only 4.35 words. Through ANOVA, we find the differences to be statistically significant (F1; 20?3.16; p?0.1). We derive from the experiment that positive emotions should be used in ISS when making users start a habit (e.g. developing a new, individual password strategy), and we conclude from our literature review that negative emotions should be used when reinforcing a habit (e.g. taking care of shoulder surfing). Originality/value – We contribute to practice by developing a user script that can be installed in all established Internet browsers. The script supports the user to choose a good passphrase strategy when registering for a new service.Wefind that trainings should not rely on facts only but must make use of emotions, which are crucial for human motivation.

abstract = {Online social networks have enabled new methods and modalities of collaboration and sharing. These advances bring privacy concerns: online social data is more accessible and persistent and simultaneously less contextualized than traditional social interactions. To allay these concerns, many web services allow users to configure their privacy settings based on a set of multiple-choice questions.We suggest a new paradigm for privacy options. Instead of suggesting the same defaults to each user, services can leverage knowledge of users' traits to recommend a machine-learned prediction of their privacy preferences for Facebook. As a case study, we build and evaluate MyPrivacy, a publicly available web application that suggests personalized privacy settings. An evaluation with 199 users shows that users find the suggestions to be appropriate and private; furthermore, they express intent to implement the recommendations made by MyPrivacy. This supports the proposal to put personalization to work in online communities to promote privacy and security.},

This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher interjudge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.},

abstract = {Home computers are frequently the target of malicious attackers because they are usually administered by non-experts. Prior work has found that users who make security decisions about their home computers often possess different mental models of information security threats, and use those mental models to make decisions about security. Using a survey, we asked a large representative sample of United States Internet users about different causal beliefs related to computer security, and about the actions they regularly undertake to protect their computers. We found demographic differences in both beliefs about security and security behaviors that pose challenges for helping users become more informed about security. Many participants reported weakly held beliefs about viruses and hackers, and these were the least likely to say they take protective actions. These results suggest that all security knowledge is not the same, educating users about security is not simply a more-is-better issue, and not all users should receive the same messages.},

abstract = {Context-sensitive guidance (CSG) can help users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask the user to provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security dialogs irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic dialogs continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. Audited dialogs thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic dialogs. Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited dialogs. In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional dialogs. Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks.},

abstract = {We report on the largest corpus of user-chosen passwords ever studied, consisting of anonymized password histograms representing almost 70 million Yahoo! users, mitigating privacy concerns while enabling analysis of dozens of subpopulations based on demographic factors and site usage characteristics. This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

@article{Barbera2013,
abstract = {The ever increasing ubiquitousness of WiFi access points, coupled with the diffusion of smartphones, suggest that Internet every time and everywhere will soon (if not already has) become a reality. Even in presence of 3G connectivity, our devices are built to switch automatically to WiFi networks so to improve user experience. Most of the times, this is achieved by recurrently broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), like, e.g., "Home WiFi", "Campus WiFi", and so on. In a large gathering of people, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario rises a natural question: "Can significant information on the social structure of a large crowd and on its socioeconomic status be inferred by looking at smartphone probes?". In this work we give a positive answer to this question. We organized a 3-months long campaign, through which we collected around 11M probes sent by more than 160K different devices. During the campaign we targeted national and international events that attracted large crowds as well as other gatherings of people. Then, we present a simple and automatic methodology to build the underlying social graph of the smartphone users, starting from their probes. We do so for each of our target events, and find that they all feature social-network properties. In addition, we show that, by looking at the probes in an event, we can learn important sociological aspects of its participants---language, vendor adoption, and so on.},

Both research and business have shown interest in studying the possibilities and risks related to these relatively new phenomena. Frequently discussed aspects that are tightly bound to online communities are their implications and effects on privacy issues. Available literature has shown that users generally disclose very much (private) information on such communities, and different factors influencing this behaviour were identified and studied. However, the influence and predictive power of personality traits on information disclosure in online communities has not yet been the subject of analysis. In this paper we report the results of an online survey investigating the relations between personality traits (based on the Fife-Factor Model), usage patterns and information disclosure of participants in different types of online communities.},

annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- the authors propose a system that lets the users choose their own authentication scheme.
- available schemes: Persuasive Text Passwords, Persuasive Cued Click Points, object passtiles, text passwords (baseline)
2. How did they do it?
- the conducted a small, 2 week user study with 39 participants who were prompted to log in to web sites from the MVP web-auth framework (see [5]). 

3. What was their goal?
- find evidence for/against hypotheses: h1: user do not prefer one over the other; h2: the users first take the time to learn sth about the available schemes; h3: users like CYOA

4. What are the results?
- surprise surprise: all hypotheses were confirmed. 
- users avoided Persuasive Text Password for their second account. 
- no preference of text passwords
- when people tried out a novel scheme, they switched back to text passwords and vice versa.
- users who spend more time reading the intro, were more likely to use novel schemes.
- users don't base their choice on security concerns.
- users did not switch their chosen scheme when resetting.

5. What could be improved?
- the conclusions are clearly flawed.
- the participants simply were open-minded study participants who also would behave differently in real life. 
- the statistics are traditional hypothesis tests that cannot be taken too seriously with this N
- within two weeks for artificial, uninteresting accounts it's no surprise that users did not reset their passwords / schemes. 
- the chosen schemes were all published by the authors and no one else likes them. authors were clearly biased in favor of them. 

Ah. The idea is great, but I really hate how they put it into practice and what they claim with their study. They could have done better.

They provide sound arguments that certain social cognitive biases are in fact designed and functional, resulting in better solutions to adaptive problems than cognitive mechanisms that "accurately" detected social signals. They call for an evolutionary reformulation of the entire "heuristics and biases" literature, which typically cast humans as making illogical and unfounded errors. This new line of work has already led to the discovery of new cognitive biases and offers much promise for the future discovery of additional adaptive biases. It also may lead to the detumescence of decades of work that has cast humans erroneously as fundamentally irrational and hopelessly muddled in their judgment and decision making. },

In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

@article{Wood2007,
abstract = {The present model outlines the mechanisms underlying habitual control of responding and the ways in which habits interface with goals. Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between responses and the features of performance contexts that have historically covaried with them (e.g., physical settings, preceding actions). Once a habit is formed, perception of contexts triggers the associated response without a mediating goal. Nonetheless, habits interface with goals. Constraining this interface, habit associations accrue slowly and do not shift appreciably with current goal states or infrequent counterhabitual responses. Given these constraints, goals can (a) direct habits by motivating repetition that leads to habit formation and by promoting exposure to cues that trigger habits, (b) be inferred from habits, and (c) interact with habits in ways that preserve the learned habit associations. Finally, the authors outline the implications of the model for habit change, especially for the self-regulation of habit cuing.},

abstract = {Millions of users are exposed to password-strength meters/checkers at highly popular web services that use user- chosen passwords for authentication. Recent studies have found evidence that some meters actually guide users to choose better passwords—which is a rare bit of good news in password research. However, these meters are mostly based on ad-hoc design. At least, as we found, most vendors do not provide any explanation of their design choices, sometimes making them appear to be a black box. We analyze password meters deployed in selected popular websites, by measuring the strength labels assigned to common passwords from several password dictio- naries. From this empirical analysis with millions of passwords, we report prominent characteristics of meters as deployed at popular websites. We shed light on how the server-end of some meters functions, provide examples of highly inconsistent strength outcomes for the same password in different meters, along with examples of many weak passwords being labeled as strong or even very strong. These weaknesses and inconsistencies may confuse users in choosing a stronger password, and thus may weaken the purpose of these meters. On the other hand, we believe these findings may help improve existing meters, and possibly make them an effective tool in the long run. I.},

This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

They call for an evolutionary reformulation of the entire "heuristics and biases" literature, which typically cast humans as making illogical and unfounded errors. This new line of work has already led to the discovery of new cognitive biases and offers much promise for the future discovery of additional adaptive biases.

abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

Simplistic models of user and attacker behaviors have led the research community to emphasize the wrong threats. Authentication is a classification problem amenable to machine learning, with many signals in addition to the password available to large Web services. Passwords will continue as a useful signal for the foreseeable future, where the goal is not impregnable security but reducing harm at acceptable cost.},

abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

Behavioral economics has produced theories to explain when and why people make such allegedly irrational decisions, for example if it comes to spending money. However, humans tend to use reference points to judge and decide. Nowadays, mobile devices can work as flexible tools to create reference points thus supporting decisions without being explicit about it. We discuss if and how mobile apps can influence decision making. As a consequence, apps can be built to better fit into the decision making progress. We argue that applying concepts from behavioral economics can increase user experience in a subtle manner.},

abstract = {Emoji are commonly used in modern text communication. However, as graphics with nuanced details, emoji may be open to interpretation. Emoji also render differently on different viewing platforms (e.g., Apple's iPhone vs. Google's Nexus phone), potentially leading to communication errors. We explore whether emoji renderings or differences across platforms give rise to diverse interpretations of emoji. Through an online survey, we solicit people's interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25{\%} of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase. Overall, we find significant potential for miscommunication, both for individual emoji renderings and for different emoji renderings across platforms.},

@inproceedings{Herley2008ProfitlessEndeavor,
abstract = {Conventional wisdom is that phishing represents easy money. In this paper we examine the economics that underly the phenomenon, and find a very different pic- ture. Phishing is a classic example of tragedy of the commons, where there is open access to a resource that has limited ability to regenerate. Since each phisher in- dependently seeks to maximize his return, the resource is over-grazed and yields far less than it is capable of. The situation stabilizes only when the average phisher is making only as much as he gives up in opportunity cost. Since the picture we paint is at variance with accepted wisdom we check against several publicly available data sources on phishing. We find the oft-quoted survey- based estimates of phishing losses unreliable. In par- ticular the victimization rate found in most surveys is smaller than the margin of error, and dollar losses are estimated by averaging unverified self-reported num- bers. We estimate that recent public estimates over- state phishing losses by as much as a factor of fifty. This economic portrait illuminates our enemy in an entirely new light. Far from being a path to riches, phishing appears to be a low-skill low-reward business. The enormous amount of phishing activity is evidence of its failure to deliver riches rather than its success, as phishers send more and more email hoping for their share of the bounty that eludes them. Repetition of questionable survey results and unsubstantiated anec- dotes makes things worse by ensuring a steady supply of new entrants.},

@article{Bellur2014,
abstract = {Communication research based on social cognition draws heavily from dual process models such as the heuristic-systematic model. Both heuristic and systematic processing are said to be aided by quick rules of thumb or mental shortcuts called heuristics. However, the operationalization of heuristics is quite problematic because their use in decision-making is not directly measured. Scholars claim the operation of specific heuristics in specific situations, based often on clever experimental evidence. We propose a methodological framework that calls for both manipulation and measurement of heuristics in order to offer more direct evidence of their operation. We first review different existing approaches in the literature for operationalizing heuristics. We then discuss our approach and describe the application of moderated mediation to analyze the resulting data. We conclude with a study idea and simulated data that illustrate how our proposed design and analysis framework could be applied in communication research.},

In a network setting, individual risk can extend to all networked users. Endpoint security refers to the set of organizational policies, procedures, and practices directed at securing the endpoint of the network connections – the individual end user. As such, the challenges facing IT managers in providing effective endpoint security are unique in that they often rely heavily on end user participation. But vulnerability can be minimized through modification of desktop security programs and increased vigilance on the part of the system administrator or CSO. The cost-prohibitive nature of these measures generally dictates targeting high-risk users on an individual basis. It is therefore important to differentiate between individuals who are most likely to pose a security risk and those who will likely follow most organizational policies and procedures. Keywords},

abstract = {People see themselves as less susceptible to bias than others. We show that a source of this bias blind spot involves the value that people place, and believe they should place, on introspective information (relative to behavioral information) when assessing bias in themselves versus others. Participants considered introspective information more than behavioral information for assessing bias in themselves, but not others. This divergence did not arise simply from differences in introspective access. The blind spot persisted when observers had access to the introspections of the actor whose bias they judged. And, participants claimed that they, but not their peers, should rely on introspections when making self-assessments of bias. Only after being educated about the importance of nonconscious processes in guiding judgment and action-and thereby about the fallibility of introspection-did participants cease denying their relative susceptibility to bias. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Instead of re- membering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better re- member their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.},

@inproceedings{Yang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity,
abstract = {Text-based passwords continue to be the prime form of authentication to computer systems. Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile text entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to traditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable security: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password security. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and probabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed cracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect of text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental groups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password than the control group ({\$}t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004{\$}). The choices for character types in each group were also significantly different ({\$}p=0.048, FET{\$}). Our cracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across groups ({\$}p=0.031, FET{\$}) and text entry method vulnerabilities. Our findings contribute to the understanding of password security in the context of usable interfaces.},

Given the risks of using weak passwords, there is a need to effectively motivate users to select strong passwords. In this study we examine the influence of interactivity, as well as static and interactive fear appeals, on motivating users to increase the strength of their passwords. We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries. We found that while the interactive password strength meter and static fear appeal treatments were not effective, the interactive fear appeal treatment resulted in significantly stronger passwords. Our findings suggest that interactive fear appeals are a promising means of encouraging a range of secure behaviors in end users.},

abstract = {Phishers are fraudsters that mimic legitimate websites to steal user's credential information and exploit that information for identity theft and other criminal activities. Various anti-phishing techniques attempt to mitigate such attacks. Domain highlighting is one such approach recently incorporated by several popular web browsers. The idea is simple: the domain name of an address is highlighted in the address bar, so that users can inspect it to determine a web site's legitimacy. Our research asks a basic question: how well does domain highlighting work? To answer this, we showed 22 participants 16 web pages typical of those targeted for phishing attacks, where participants had to determine the page's legitimacy. In the first round, they judged the page's legitimacy by whatever means they chose. In the second round, they were directed specifically to look at the address bar. We found that participants fell into 3 types in terms of how they determined the legitimacy of a web page; while domain highlighting was somewhat effective for one user type, it was much less effective for others. We conclude that domain highlighting, while providing some benefit, cannot be relied upon as the sole method to prevent phishing attacks.},

We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

abstract = {We report on the largest corpus of user-chosen passwords ever studied, consisting of anonymized password histograms representing almost 70 million Yahoo! users, mitigating privacy concerns while enabling analysis of dozens of subpopulations based on demographic factors and site usage characteristics. This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

A study of banking and security in Australia shows that the practice of sharing passwords does not conform to this requirement. For married and de facto couples, password sharing is seen as a practical way of managing money and a demonstration of trust. Sharing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) is a common practice among remote indigenous communities in Australia. In areas with poor banking access, this is the only way to access cash. People with certain disabilities have to share passwords with carers, and PIN numbers with retail clerks. In this paper we present the findings of a qualitative user study of banking and money management. We suggest design criteria for banking security systems, based on observed social and cultural practices of password and PIN number sharing.},

abstract = {Randomly generated alphanumeric passwords are widely used to restrict access to com- puter networks but are readily forgotten, resulting in costs to both organizations and users. In order to address this, there is a need to develop and evaluate new forms of memorable passwords. Drawing on memory research and the importance of meaning, the efficacy of three alternative “password” systems having varying degrees of personal meaning were compared with the more traditional but personally meaningless randomly generated alphanumeric passwords. Twenty experienced computer users self-generated four-string variable passwords based on alphanumerics, symbols of personal meaning and faces. Additionally, participants were assigned a meaningless, randomly generated four-character alphanumeric password. Password memorability was measured in terms of acquisition (number of trials/time to criterion), retention (fromforgetting functions) and retrieval (time to recall/recognize the passwords). Meaning was found to assist memora- bility and a mediating effect of familiarity was also observed.

@article{Arachchilage2013GameDesingPhishing,
abstract = {Game based education is becoming more and more popular. This is because game based education provides an opportunity for learning in a natural environment. Phishing is an online identity theft, which attempts to steal sensitive information such as username, password, and online banking details from its victims. To prevent this, phishing awareness needs to be considered. This research aims to develop a game design framework, which enhances user avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect users from phishing attacks. In order to do this, a theoretical model derived from Technology Thread Avoidance Theory (TTAT) was developed and used in the game design framework (Liang {\&} Xue, 2010). A survey study was undertaken with 150 regular computer users to elicit feedback through a questionnaire. The study findings revealed that perceived threat, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost, self-efficacy, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility elements should be addressed in the game design framework for computer users to avoid phishing attacks. Furthermore, we argue that this game design framework can be used not only for preventing phishing attacks but also for preventing other malicious IT attacks such as viruses, malware, botnets and spyware.{\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{McCrae1987,
abstract = {Test scores of divergent thinking obtained between 1959 and 1972 were correlated with a variety of personality measures administered since 1980. In this sample of 268 men, divergent thinking was consistently associated with self-reports and ratings of openness to experience, but not with neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, or conscientiousness. Both divergent thinking and openness were also modestly correlated with Gough's (1979) empirically derived Creative Personality Scale. Several other personality variables mentioned in the literature were also examined; those that were associated with divergent thinking were also generally correlated with openness. These data suggest that creativity is particularly related to the personality domain of openness to experience. Although some object that the distinction is artificial (Heim, 1970), cognition and personality have traditionally been seen as distinct domains. Intelligence is construed as a set of aptitudes and abilities; personality is viewed, at least by psychometricians, as a collection of characteristic dispositions. Empirically, there is some justification for the separation. Measures of personality traits typically show very modest correlations with tests of general intelligence (e.g., Eysenck {\&} Eysenck, 1975), and joint factor analyses of personality and cognitive ability variables show that the latter form a distinct factor (McCrae {\&} Costa, 1985b, 1985c). Creativity, however, seems to hold an intermediate position. The novelty and originality of creative productions imply both an ability to think fluently and flexibly and an inclination to do so. A voluminous literature has documented the importance of both these aspects of creativity (Barron {\&} Harrington, 1981). In this article, I attempt to organize the findings on personality characteristics associated with creativity by reference to a well-established taxonomy of personality traits. Specifically, I am testing the hypothesis that creativity is uniquely associated with the personality domain of openness to experience. Creativity, TS  - RIS},

annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Expert Password Management - Stobert, Elizabeth; Biddle, Robert)

1. What did the authors do?
- try to understand the password coping strategies of expert users (security experts)

2. How did they do it?
- semi-structured interviews (30 minutes), just like Password-Life cycle paper
- invitation from the group and few from the community
- no money paid to participants. 

3. What was their goal?
- give recommendations to non-expert users based on what the experts do
- identify flaws in experts' password management
- understand why certain strategies are preferable

4. What are the results?
- experts are more likely to use password managers
- password managers are mostly used for valuable accounts
- experts see password managers as cumbersome and an additional burden
- experts show consistency in their strategies
- experts also reuse passwords and write them down
- users write down passwords that they do not need often (so no interference effects!)
- experts have a lot more accounts that non-experts
- creative password creation strategies (experts can clearly communicate their algorithms)
- experts plan for failure (eg. don't use symbols or long passwords, in case they have to enter them on mobiles)
- risk assessment is highly personal and subjective
- there is a misconception that people think that only they have a certain password strategy.

5. What could be improved?
- understand individual motivation (biases) --{\textgreater} personalized strategies
- recruit at a conference instead of the own group
- boost ecological validity. show passwords and then ask "which password resembles your own email password the most? why?"

This paper reports a study in which users perceptions of password mechanisms were investigated through questionnaires and interviews. Analysis of the questionnaires shows that many users report problems, linked to the number of passwords and frequency of password use. In-depth analysis of the interview data revealed that the degree to which users conform to security mechanisms depends on their perception of security levels, information sensitivity and compatibility with work practices. Security mechanisms incompatible with these perceptions may be circumvented by users and thereby undermine system security overall.},

Only in recent years has the security research community acknowledged that user behavior plays a part in many security failures, and that policies alone may not be sufficient to ensure correct behavior. We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind. We present the results of a first study that can guide such persuasive efforts, and describe methods that can be used to persuade users to employ proper password practice.},

This attack method, commonly known as “phishing,” is most commonly initiated by sending out emails with links to spoofed websites that harvest information. We present a method for detecting these attacks, which in its most gen- eral form is an application of machine learning on a fea- ture set designed to highlight user-targeted deception in electronic communication. This method is applicable, with slight modification, to detection of phishing websites, or the emails used to direct victims to these sites. We evaluate this method on a set of approximately 860 such phishing emails, and 6950 non-phishing emails, and correctly identify over 96{\%} of the phishing emails while only mis-classifying on the order of 0.1{\%} of the legitimate emails. We conclude with thoughts on the future for such techniques to specifi- cally identify deception, specifically with respect to the evo- lutionary nature of the attacks and information available.},

@article{Maruna2006,
abstract = {The notion of ‘cognitive distortion' has become enshrined in the offender treatment literature over the last 20 years, yet the concept still suffers from a lack of definitional clarity. In particular, the umbrella term is often used to refer to offence-supportive attitudes, cognitive processing during an offence sequence, as well as post-hoc neutralisations or excuses for offending. Of these very different processes, the last one might be the most popular and problematic. Treatment programmes for offenders often aim to eliminate excuse-making as a primary aim, and decision-makers place great weight on the degree to which an offender “takes responsibility” for his or her offending. Yet, the relationship between these after-the-fact explanations and future crime is not at all clear. Indeed, the designation of post hoc excuses as criminogenic may itself be an example of fallacious thinking. After all, outside of the criminal context, post hoc excuse-making is widely viewed as normal, healthy, and socially rewarded behaviour. We argue that the open exploration of contextual risk factors leading to offending can help in the identification of criminogenic factors as well as strengthen the therapeutic experience. Rather than insist that offenders take “responsibility” for the past, we suggest that efforts should focus on helping them take responsibility for the future, shifting the therapeutic focus from post hoc excuses to offence-supportive attitudes and underlying cognitive schemas that are empirically linked to re-offending.},

abstract = {When browsing the Internet, users are likely to be exposed to security and privacy threats – like fraudulent websites. Automatic browser mechanisms can protect them only to some extent. In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

abstract = {Background: Human beings are an integral part of com-puter security, whether we actively participate or simply build the systems. Despite this importance, understand-ing users and their interaction with security is a blind spot for most security practitioners and designers. Aim: Define principles for conducting experiments into usable security and privacy, to improve study robustness and usefulness. Data: The authors' experiences conducting several re-search projects complemented with a literature survey. Method: We extract principles based on relevance to the advancement of the state of the art. We then justify our choices by providing published experiments as cases of where the principles are and are not followed in practice to demonstrate the impact. Each principle is a discipline-specific instantiation of desirable experiment-design ele-ments as previously established in the domain of philos-ophy of science. Results: Five high-priority principles – (i) give par-ticipants a primary task; (ii) incorporate realistic risk; (iii) avoid priming the participants; (iv) perform double-blind experiments whenever possible and (v) think care-fully about how meaning is assigned to the terms threat model, security, privacy, and usability. Conclusion: The principles do not replace researcher acumen or experience, however they can provide a valu-able service for facilitating evaluation, guiding younger researchers and students, and marking a baseline com-mon language for discussing further improvements.},

abstract = {Investigations of computer user behavior become especially important when behaviors like security software adoption affect organizational information resource security, but adoption antecedents remain elusive. Technology adoption studies typically predict behavioral outcomes by investigating the relationship between attitudes and intentions, though intention may not be the best predictor of actual behavior. Personality constructs have recently been found to explain even more variance in behavior, thus providing insights into user behavior. This research incorporates conscientiousness and agreeableness into a conceptual model of security software use. Attitudinal constructs perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were linked with behavioral intent, while the relationship between intent and actual use was found to be moderated by conscientiousness and agreeableness. The results that the moderating effect of personality greatly increases the amount of variance explained in actual use.},

abstract = {We conduct a security analysis of five popular web-based password managers. Unlike “local” password managers, web-based password managers run in the browser. We identify four key security concerns for web-based pass- word managers and, for each, identify representative vul- nerabilities through our case studies. Our attacks are se- vere: in four out of the five password managers we stud- ied, an attacker can learn a user's credentials for arbi- trary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared pass- words. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also di- verse: ranging from logic and authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in ad- dition to the typical vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure. To guide future de- velopment of password managers, we provide guidance for password managers. Given the diversity of vulner- abilities we identified, we advocate a defense-in-depth approach to ensure security of password managers},

abstract = {When time is limited, researchers may be faced with the choice of using an extremely brief measure of the Big-Five personality dimensions or using no measure at all. To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Because the toolbars are designed for humans to use, they should be evaluated for usability – that is, whether these toolbars really prevent users from being tricked into providing personal information. We conducted two user studies of three security toolbars and other browser security indicators and found them all ineffective at preventing phishing attacks. Even though subjects were asked to pay attention to the toolbar, many failed to look at it; others disregarded or explained away the toolbars' warnings if the content of web pages looked legitimate. We found that many subjects do not understand phishing attacks or realize how sophisticated such attacks can be.},

In recent years, technology has been increasingly harnessed to persuade and motivate people to engage in various behaviors. This phenomenon has also attracted substantial scholarly interest over the last decade. This review examines the results, methods, measured behavioral and psychological outcomes, affordances in implemented persuasive systems, and domains of the studies in the current body of research on persuasive technologies. The reviewed studies have investigated diverse persuasive systems/designs, psychological factors, and behavioral outcomes. The results of the reviewed studies were categorized into fully positive, partially positive, and negative and/or no effects. This review provides an overview of the state of empirical research regarding persuasive technologies. The paper functions as a reference in positioning future research within the research stream of persuasive technologies in terms of the domain, the persuasive stimuli and the psychological and behavioral outcomes.},

abstract = {We examine patterns of human choice in a passphrase-based authentication system deployed by Amazon, a large online merchant. We tested the availability of a large corpus of over 100,000 possible phrases at Amazons registration page, which prohibits using any phrase already registered by another user. A number of large, readily-available lists such as movie and book titles prove effective in guessing attacks, suggesting that passphrases are vulnerable to dictionary attacks like all schemes involving human choice. Extending our analysis with natural language phrases extracted from linguistic corpora, we find that phrase selection is far from random, with users strongly preferring simple noun bigrams which are common in natural language. The distribution of cho- sen passphrases is less skewed than the distribution of bigrams in English text, indicating that some users have attempted to choose phrases ran- domly. Still, the distribution of bigrams in natural language is not nearly random enough to resist offline guessing, nor are longer three- or four- word phrases for which we see rapidly diminishing returns.},

A client component on users' machines recorded a variety of password strength, usage and frequency metrics. This allows us to measure or estimate such quantities as the average number of passwords and average number of accounts each user has, how many passwords she types per day, how often passwords are shared among sites, and how often they are forgotten. We get extremely detailed data on password strength, the types and lengths of passwords chosen, and how they vary by site. The data is the first large scale study of its kind, and yields numerous other insights into the role the passwords play in users' online experience.},

@article{Dhamija2005PhishHips,
abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new class of Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) that allow a human to distinguish one computer from another. Unlike traditional HIPs, where the computer issues a challenge to the user over a network, in this case, the user issues a challenge to the computer. This type of HIP can be used to detect phishing attacks, in which websites are spoofed in order to trick users into revealing private information. We define five properties of an ideal HIP to detect phishing attacks. Using these properties, we evaluate existing and proposed anti-phishing schemes to discover their benefits and weaknesses. We review a new anti-phishing proposal, Dynamic Security Skins (DSS), and show that it meets the HIP criteria. Our goal is to allow a remote server to prove its identity in a way that is easy for a human user to verify and hard for an attacker to spoof. In our scheme, the web server presents its proof in the form of an image that is unique for each user and each transaction. To authenticate the server, the user can visually verify that the image presented by the server matches a reference image presented by the browser.},

This attack method, commonly known as “phishing,” is most commonly initiated by sending out emails with links to spoofed websites that harvest information. We present a method for detecting these attacks, which in its most gen- eral form is an application of machine learning on a fea- ture set designed to highlight user-targeted deception in electronic communication. This method is applicable, with slight modification, to detection of phishing websites, or the emails used to direct victims to these sites. We evaluate this method on a set of approximately 860 such phishing emails, and 6950 non-phishing emails, and correctly identify over 96{\%} of the phishing emails while only mis-classifying on the order of 0.1{\%} of the legitimate emails. We conclude with thoughts on the future for such techniques to specifi- cally identify deception, specifically with respect to the evo- lutionary nature of the attacks and information available.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

@inproceedings{Whitten1999WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt,
abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

@article{McCrae1987,
abstract = {Test scores of divergent thinking obtained between 1959 and 1972 were correlated with a variety of personality measures administered since 1980. In this sample of 268 men, divergent thinking was consistently associated with self-reports and ratings of openness to experience, but not with neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, or conscientiousness. Both divergent thinking and openness were also modestly correlated with Gough's (1979) empirically derived Creative Personality Scale. Several other personality variables mentioned in the literature were also examined; those that were associated with divergent thinking were also generally correlated with openness. These data suggest that creativity is particularly related to the personality domain of openness to experience. Although some object that the distinction is artificial (Heim, 1970), cognition and personality have traditionally been seen as distinct domains. Intelligence is construed as a set of aptitudes and abilities; personality is viewed, at least by psychometricians, as a collection of characteristic dispositions. Empirically, there is some justification for the separation. Measures of personality traits typically show very modest correlations with tests of general intelligence (e.g., Eysenck {\&} Eysenck, 1975), and joint factor analyses of personality and cognitive ability variables show that the latter form a distinct factor (McCrae {\&} Costa, 1985b, 1985c). Creativity, however, seems to hold an intermediate position. The novelty and originality of creative productions imply both an ability to think fluently and flexibly and an inclination to do so. A voluminous literature has documented the importance of both these aspects of creativity (Barron {\&} Harrington, 1981). In this article, I attempt to organize the findings on personality characteristics associated with creativity by reference to a well-established taxonomy of personality traits. Specifically, I am testing the hypothesis that creativity is uniquely associated with the personality domain of openness to experience. Creativity, TS  - RIS},

abstract = {Online banking is one of the most sensitive tasks performed by general Internet users. Most traditional banks now offer online banking services, and strongly encourage customers to do online banking with ‘peace of mind.' Although banks heavily advertise an apparent ‘100{\%} online security guaran- tee,' typically the fine print makes this conditional on users fulfilling certain security requirements. We examine some of these requirements as set by major Canadian banks, in terms of security and usability. We opened personal check- ing accounts at the five largest Canadian banks, and one online-only bank. We found that many security require- ments are too difficult for regular users to follow, and be- lieve that some marketing-related messages about safety and security actually mislead users. We are also interested in what kind of computer systems people really use for online banking, and whether users satisfy common online bank- ing requirements. Our survey of 123 technically advanced users from a university environment strongly supports our view of an emerging gap between banks' expectations (or at least what their written customer policy agreements imply) and users' actions related to security requirements of online banking. Our participants, being more security-aware than the general population, arguably makes our results best-case regarding what can be expected from regular users. Yet most participants failed to satisfy common security require- ments, implying most online banking customers do not (or cannot) follow banks' stated end-user security requirements and guidelines. The survey also sheds light on the security settings of systems used for sensitive online transactions. This work is intended to spur a discussion on real-world sys- tem security and user responsibilities, in a scenario where everyday users are heavily encouraged to perform critical tasks over the Internet, despite the continuing absence of appropriate tools to do so.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose and evaluate Use Your Illusion, a novel mechanism for user authentication that is secure and usable regardless of the size of the device on which it is used. Our system relies on the human ability to recognize a degraded version of a previously seen image. We illustrate how distorted images can be used to maintain the usability of graphical password schemes while making them more resilient to social engineering or observation attacks. Because it is difficult to mentally “revert” a degraded image, without knowledge of the original image, our scheme provides a strong line of defense against impostor access, while preserving the desirable memorability properties of graphical password schemes. Using low-fidelity tests to aid in the design, we implement prototypes of Use Your Illusion as i) an Ajax-based web service and ii) on Nokia N70 cellular phones. We conduct a between-subjects usability study of the cellular phone prototype with a total of 99 participants in two experiments. We demonstrate that, regardless of their age or gender, users are very skilled at recognizing degraded versions of self-chosen images, even on small displays and after time periods of one month. Our results indicate that graphical passwords with distorted images can achieve equivalent error rates to those using traditional images, but only when the original image is known.},

@article{Grady1998NeuralCorrelates,
abstract = {A striking characteristic of human memory is that pictures are remembered better than words. We examined the neural correlates of memory for pictures and words in the context of episodic memory encoding to determine material-specific differences in brain activity patterns. To do this, we used positron emission tomography to map the brain regions active during encoding of words and pictures of objects. Encoding was carried out by using three different strategies to explore possible interactions between material specificity and types of processing. Encoding of pictures resulted in greater activity of bilateral visual and medial temporal cortices, compared with encoding words, whereas encoding of words was associated with increased activity in prefrontal and temporoparietal regions related to language function. Each encoding strategy was characterized by a distinctive activity pattern, but these patterns were largely the same for pictures and words. Thus, superior overall memory for pictures may be mediated by more effective and automatic engagement of areas important for visual memory, including medial temporal cortex, whereas the mechanisms underlying specific encoding strategies appear to operate similarly on pictures and words.},

These heuristics are highly economical and usually effective, but they lead to systematic and predictable errors. A better understanding of these heuristics and of the biases to which they lead could improve judgements and decisions in situations of uncertainty.},

@article{Uellenbeck2013QuantifyingSecurityPatterns,
abstract = {Graphical passwords were proposed as an alternative to over- come the inherent limitations of text-based passwords, in- spired by research that shows that the graphical memory of humans is particularly well developed. A graphical password scheme that has been widely adopted is the Android Unlock Pattern, a special case of the Pass-Go scheme with grid size restricted to 3×3 points and restricted stroke count. In this paper, we study the security of Android unlock pat- terns. By performing a large-scale user study, we measure actual user choices of patterns instead of theoretical consid- erations on password spaces. From this data we construct a model based on Markov chains that enables us to quantify the strength of Android unlock patterns. We found empiri- cally that there is a high bias in the pattern selection process, e. g., the upper left corner and three-point long straight lines are very typical selection strategies. Consequently, the en- tropy of patterns is rather low, and our results indicate that the security offered by the scheme is less than the security of only three digit randomly-assigned PINs for guessing 20{\%} of all passwords (i. e., we estimate a partial guessing entropy G0.2 of 9.10 bit). Based on these insights, we systematically improve the scheme by finding a small, but still effective change in the pattern layout that makes graphical user logins substantially more secure. By means of another user study, we show that some changes improve the security by more than doubling the space of actually used passwords (i. e., increasing the partial guessing entropy G0.2 to 10.81 bit).},

abstract = {Teleoperated minimally invasive surgical robots can significantly enhance a surgeon's accuracy, dexterity and visualization. However, current commercially available systems do not include significant haptic (force and tactile) feedback to the operator. This paper describes experiments to characterize this problem, as well as several methods to provide haptic feedback in order to improve surgeon's performance. There exist a variety of sensing and control methods that enable haptic feedback, although a number of practical considerations, e.g. cost, complexity and biocompatibility, present significant challenges. The ability of teleoperated robot-assisted surgical systems to measure and display haptic information leads to a number of additional exciting clinical and scientific opportunities, such as active operator assistance through "virtual fixtures" and the automatic acquisition of tissue properties.},

abstract = {The weakness of knowledge-based authentication systems, such as passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), is well known, and reflects an uneasy compromise between security and human memory constraints. Research has been undertaken for some years now into the feasibility of graphical authentication mechanisms in the hope that these will provide a more secure and memorable alternative. The graphical approach substitutes the exact recall of alphanumeric codes with the recognition of previously learnt pictures, a skill at which humans are remarkably proficient. So far, little attention has been devoted to usability, and initial research has failed to conclusively establish significant memory improvement. This paper reports two user studies comparing several implementations of the graphical approach with PINs. Results demonstrate that pictures can be a solution to some problems relating to traditional knowledge-based authentication but that they are not a simple panacea, since a poor design can eliminate the picture superiority effect in memory. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of the graphical approach and providing guidelines for developers contemplating using these mechanisms. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {People see themselves as less susceptible to bias than others. We show that a source of this bias blind spot involves the value that people place, and believe they should place, on introspective information (relative to behavioral information) when assessing bias in themselves versus others. Participants considered introspective information more than behavioral information for assessing bias in themselves, but not others. This divergence did not arise simply from differences in introspective access. The blind spot persisted when observers had access to the introspections of the actor whose bias they judged. And, participants claimed that they, but not their peers, should rely on introspections when making self-assessments of bias. Only after being educated about the importance of nonconscious processes in guiding judgment and action-and thereby about the fallibility of introspection-did participants cease denying their relative susceptibility to bias. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {This paper studies the security and memorability of free-form multitouch gestures for mobile authentication. Towards this end, we collected a dataset with a generate-test-retest paradigm where participants (N=63) generated free-form gestures, repeated them, and were later retested for memory. Half of the participants decided to generate one-finger gestures, and the other half generated multi-finger gestures. Although there has been recent work on template-based gestures, there are yet no metrics to analyze security of either template or free-form gestures. For example, entropy-based metrics used for text-based passwords are not suitable for capturing the security and memorability of free-form gestures. Hence, we modify a recently proposed metric for analyzing information capacity of continuous full-body movements for this purpose. Our metric computed estimated mutual information in repeated sets of gestures. Surprisingly, one-finger gestures had higher average mutual information. Gestures with many hard angles and turns had the highest mutual information. The best-remembered gestures included signatures and simple angular shapes. We also implemented a multitouch recognizer to evaluate the practicality of free-form gestures in a real authentication system and how they perform against shoulder surfing attacks. We discuss strategies for generating secure and memorable free-form gestures. We conclude that free-form gestures present a robust method for mobile authentication.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a study of sensing and analyzing an offline social network of participants at a large-scale music festival (8 days, 130,000+ participants). We place 33 fixed-location Bluetooth scanners in strategic spots around the festival area to discover Bluetooth-enabled mobile phones carried by the participants, and thus collect spatio-temporal traces of their mobility and interactions. We subsequently analyze the data on two levels. On the micro level, we run a community detection algorithm to reveal a variety of groups the festival participants form. On the macro level, we employ an Infinite Relational Model (IRM) in order to recover the structure of the social network related to participants' music preferences. The obtained structure in the form of clusters of concerts and participants is then interpreted using meta-information about music genres, band origins, stages, and dates of performances. We show that most of the concerts clusters can be described by one or more of the meta-features, effectively revealing preferences of participants (e.g. a cluster of US bands) and discuss the significance of the findings and the potential and limitations of the used method. Finally, we discuss the possibility of employing the described method and techniques for creating user-oriented applications and extending the sensing capabilities during large-scale events by introducing user involvement.},

A study of banking and security in Australia shows that the practice of sharing passwords does not conform to this requirement. For married and de facto couples, password sharing is seen as a practical way of managing money and a demonstration of trust. Sharing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) is a common practice among remote indigenous communities in Australia. In areas with poor banking access, this is the only way to access cash. People with certain disabilities have to share passwords with carers, and PIN numbers with retail clerks. In this paper we present the findings of a qualitative user study of banking and money management. We suggest design criteria for banking security systems, based on observed social and cultural practices of password and PIN number sharing.},

They call for an evolutionary reformulation of the entire "heuristics and biases" literature, which typically cast humans as making illogical and unfounded errors. This new line of work has already led to the discovery of new cognitive biases and offers much promise for the future discovery of additional adaptive biases. It also may lead to the detumescence of decades of work that has cast humans erroneously as fundamentally irrational and hopelessly muddled in their judgment and decision making.

abstract = {This article offers a brief introduction to research on risk, uncertainty, and human decision making and how they relate to users making security decisions, and provides a few key concepts and possibilities in how they may be used to improve users' security behavior.Core to security on an everyday basis is the compliance of the end user, but how do we get them to make good decisions when they are often the weakest link in the chain? Users must be less motivated to choose anti-security options and more motivated to choose pro-security options. Obviously, no one would suggest training end users with USB devices that deliver an electric shock or food pellet reward based on their actions. But, generally speaking, we can increase compliance if we work with the psychological principles that drive behavior. The ideal security user experience for most users would be none at all. The vast majority would be content to use computers to enrich their lives while taking for granted a perfectly secure and reliable infrastructure that makes it all possible. Security only becomes a priority for many when they have problems with it. However, now, and in the foreseeable future, users are in the control loop. We must design systems with an understanding that, at some point, must make a decision regarding security.},

Regrettably, most proposed methods of strengthening passwords compromise memorability. This paper explores a lightweight password creation mechanism's effect on password memorability. Our system employs Persuasive Technology to assist users in creating stronger passwords. Results show that our improvement scheme affected password memorability only for users who created secure passwords before the system applied its improvement. This result warns researchers to not alienate users who are already security-aware when trying to assist security-unaware users to behave more securely.},

@inproceedings{Mazurek2013Measuring,
abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

While categories limit the number of emoji in each individual list, the overall number is still so large, that emoji entry is a challenging task. The task takes particularly long if users pick the wrong category when searching for an emoji. Instead, we propose a new zooming keyboard for emoji entry. Here, users can see all emoji at once, aiding in building spatial memory where related emoji are to be found. We compare our zooming emoji keyboard against the Google keyboard and find that our keyboard allows for 18{\%} faster emoji entry, reducing the required time for one emoji from 15.6s to 12.7s. A preliminary longitudinal evaluation with three participants showed that emoji entry time over the duration of the study improved at up to 60{\%} to a final average of 7.5s.},

@article{Wirz2013CrowdDensity,
abstract = {City-scale mass gatherings attract hundreds of thousands of pedestrians. These pedestrians need to be monitored constantly to detect critical crowd situations at an early stage and to mitigate the risk that situations evolve towards dangerous incidents. Hereby, the crowd density is an important characteristic to assess the criticality of crowd situations. In this work, we consider location-aware smartphones for monitoring crowds during mass gatherings as an alternative to established video-based solutions. We follow a participatory sensing approach in which pedestrians share their locations on a voluntary basis. As participation is voluntarily, we can assume that only a fraction of all pedestrians shares location information. This raises a challenge when concluding about the crowd density. We present a methodology to infer the crowd density even if only a limited set of pedestrians share their locations. Our methodology is based on the assumption that the walking speed of pedestrians depends on the crowd density. By modeling this behavior, we can infer a crowd density estimation. We evaluate our methodology with a real-world data set collected during the Lord Mayor's Show 2011 in London. This festival attracts around half a million spectators and we obtained the locations of 828 pedestrians. With this data set, we first verify that the walking speed of pedestrians depends on the crowd density. In particular, we identify a crowd density-dependent upper limit speed with which pedestrians move through urban spaces. We then evaluate the accuracy of our methodology by comparing our crowd density estimates to ground truth information obtained from video cameras used by the authorities. We achieve an average calibration error of and confirm the appropriateness of our model. With a discussion of the limitations of our methodology, we identify the area of application and conclude that smartphones are a promising tool for crowd monitoring.},

abstract = {Would you make the same decisions in a foreign language as you would in your native tongue? It may be intuitive that people would make the same choices regardless of the language they are using, or that the difficulty of using a foreign language would make decisions less systematic. We discovered, however, that the opposite is true: Using a foreign language reduces decision-making biases. Four experiments show that the framing effect disappears when choices are presented in a foreign tongue. Whereas people were risk averse for gains and risk seeking for losses when choices were presented in their native tongue, they were not influenced by this framing manipulation in a foreign language. Two additional experiments show that using a foreign language reduces loss aversion, increasing the acceptance of both hypothetical and real bets with positive expected value. We propose that these effects arise because a foreign language provides greater cognitive and emotional distance than a native tongue does.},

A well designed password policy helps users create and manage more effective passwords. This paper offers a novel model and tool for understanding, creating, and testing password policies. We present a password policy simulation model which incorporates such factors as simulated users, accounts, and services. This model and its implementation enable administrators responsible for creating and managing password policies to test them before giving them to actual users. It also allows researchers to test how different password policy factors impact security, without the time and expense of actual human studies. We begin by presenting our password policy simulation model. We next discuss prior work and validate the model by showing how it is consistent with previous research conducted on human users. We then present and discuss experimental results derived using the model.},

@article{Marengo2017,
abstract = {The increasing popularity of text-based computer mediated communication, such as instant messaging and mobile texting, have resulted in the emergence of a new pictographic form of language, i.e. emoji, offering an intuitive and informal way to convey emotions and attitudes, replacing words or phrases in text messages. Based on these characteristics, could identification with emoji be associated with personality? Could they be used instead of text-based items in personality assessment? The present study aimed at exploring these questions. The sample is composed of 234 young adults recruited online (age: M = 24.79, SD = 6.47; 62{\%} female). Participants responded to a brief Big-Five personality questionnaire and a 91-item survey assessing participants' degree of self-identification with emoji selected from the Apple Color Emoji fontset. Results indicated that 36 out of 91 examined emoji are significantly related with three of the Big-Five personality traits - emotional stability, extraversion, and agreeableness - that are consistently linked with emotion and affective processing. Emoji-based measures of these personality traits show moderate-to-large concurrent validity with scores from a validated personality questionnaire (r = 0.6–0.8). Overall, our study advances the idea that emoji might be employed to develop a language-free assessment tool for personality.},

abstract = {The empirical study of aesthetics in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is concerned with - among other topics - the relationship between beauty and usability and the general impact of beauty on product choice and use. Specifically, the present paper explores the notion of a "beauty dilemma" - the idea that people discount beauty in a choice situation, although they value it in general (i.e., they are not choosing what makes them happy). We explored this idea in three studies with a total of over 600 participants. Study 1 revealed a reluctance to pay for beauty due to its hedonic nature (i.e., associated with luxury etc.). Study 2 showed that people prefer a more beautiful product, but justify their choice by referring to spurious advantages in usability. Finally, Study 3 revealed that a choice situation which requires a trade-off between beauty and usability, and which offers no further way to justify choosing beauty, leads to a sharp increase in the preference of usability. The underlying reasons for this "beauty dilemma" and further implications are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Kroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication,
abstract = {The fields of security and usability often conflict with each other. Security focuses on making systems difficult for attackers to compromise. However, doing this also increases difficulty for the user. Users in security are often seen as an obstacle - they are the weakest point of the system, willing to circumvent security policies in order to access their work faster. A large part of security is authentication: knowing who a user of a system is and denying access to unauthenticated users. Authentication is very often the starting point of user interaction with security systems. Unfortunately, authentication is still most commonly achieved using text-based passwords. This is often the easiest and cheapest system to implement. Most websites and services advise users to select unique, complex and lengthy passwords. These passwords are difficult for users to remember and often lead to irresponsible behaviour such as writing down or reusing passwords. Serious games are games that are designed for a different primary purpose than pure entertainment. This field includes gamification, where non-gaming contexts are enhanced by using principles from gaming. Examples include experience points, achievements, progress indicators and leader boards. Gamification uses these tools to persuade users to change their behaviour. If gamification can be applied to security, it may aid in convincing users to act more securely. This paper discusses the possibilities of applying gamification to authentication as a new approach to usability and security.},

We then compare existing mobile text entry methods against this estimate and find that the vast majority of text entry methods in the literature are substantially slower. This analysis suggests the mobile text entry field needs to focus on methods that can viably approach the inviscid entry rate.},

abstract = {The emerging ambient persuasive technology looks very promising for many areas of personal and ubiquitous computing. Persuasive applications aim at changing human attitudes or behavior through the power of software designs. This theory-creating article suggests the concept of a behavior change support system (BCSS), whether web-based, mobile, ubiquitous, or more traditional information system to be treated as the core of research into persuasion, influence, nudge, and coercion. This article provides a foundation for studying BCSSs, in which the key constructs are the O/C matrix and the PSD model. It will (1) introduce the archetypes of behavior change via BCSSs, (2) describe the design process for building per- suasive BCSSs, and (3) exemplify research into BCSSs through the domain of health interventions. Recognizing the themes put forward in this article will help leverage the full potential of computing for producing behavioral changes. Keywords},

@article{Diefenbach2011,
abstract = {With the experiential turn in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), academics and practitioners broaden their focus from mere task-fulfillment (i.e., the pragmatic) to a holistic view, encompassing universal human needs such as relatedness or popularity (i.e., the hedonic). Accordingly, many theoretical models of User Experience (UX) acknowledge the hedonic as an important aspect of a product's appeal. In choice situations, however, people (i.e., users, consumers) overemphasize the pragmatic, but fail to acknowledge the hedonic. The present research explores the reasons for this phenomenon. We suggest that people attend to the justifiability of hedonic and pragmatic attributes rather than to their impact on experience. In other words, they choose what is easy to justify and not what they enjoy the most. Since providing justifications is easier for pragmatic than hedonic attributes, people arrive at a primarily pragmatic choice, even if they would feel better with the hedonic. We explored this assumption, called the Hedonic Dilemma, in four empirical studies. Study 1 (N = 118) revealed a positive correlation between the need for justification and pragmatic choice. Study 2 (N = 125) explored affective consequences and justifications provided for hedonic and pragmatic choices. We further explored two different ways to reduce the Hedonic Dilemma. Study 3 (N = 178) enhanced the justifiability of hedonic choice through product information which suggested hedonic attributes as legitimate. In consequence, hedonic choice increased. Study 4 (N = 133) manipulated the need for justification through framing the choice context. A significant positive effect of a "low need for justification" frame on purchase rates occurred for a hedonic but not for a pragmatic product. Our research has a number of implications, reaching from how to elicit requirements to general strategic considerations when designing (for) experiences. ?? 2011 British Informatics Society Limited.

Users may take immediate action or ignore them depending on the importance of a notification as well as their current context. The nature of notifications is manifold, applications use them both sparsely and frequently. In this paper we present the first large-scale analysis of mobile notifications with a focus on users' subjective perceptions. We derive a holistic picture of notifications on mobile phones by collecting close to 200 million notifications from more than 40,000 users. Using a data-driven approach, we break down what users like and dislike about notifications. Our results reveal differences in importance of notifications and how users value notifications from messaging apps as well as notifications that include information about people and events. Based on these results we derive a number of findings about the nature of notifications and guidelines to effectively use them.},

This review examines the results, methods, measured behavioral and psychological outcomes, affordances in implemented persuasive systems, and domains of the studies in the current body of research on persuasive technologies. The reviewed studies have investigated diverse persuasive systems/designs, psychological factors, and behavioral outcomes. The results of the reviewed studies were categorized into fully positive, partially positive, and negative and/or no effects. This review provides an overview of the state of empirical research regarding persuasive technologies. The paper functions as a reference in positioning future research within the research stream of persuasive technologies in terms of the domain, the persuasive stimuli and the psychological and behavioral outcomes.},

@incollection{Treisman1985PreattentiveProcessingInVision,
abstract = {Visual analysis appears to be functionally divided between an early preattentive level of processing at which simple features are coded spatially in parallel and a later stage at which focused attention is required to conjoin the separate features into coherent objects. Evidence supporting this dichotomy comes from behavioral studies of visual search, from differences in the ease of texture segregation, from reports of illusory conjunctions when attention is overloaded, from subjects' ability to identify simple features correctly even when they mislocate them, and from the substantial benefit of pre-cuing the location of a relevant item when the task requires that features be conjoined but not when simple features are sufficient. Some further studies of search have revealed a striking asymmetry between several pairs of stimuli which differ in the presence or absence of a single part or property. The asymmetry depends solely on which of the pair is allocated the role of target and which is replicated to form the background items. It suggests that search for the presence of a visual primitive is automatic and parallel, whereas search for the absence of the same feature is serial and requires focused attention. The search asymmetry can be used as an additional diagnostic to help define the functional features extracted by the visual system.},

abstract = {Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

Because of this perception, a growing body of research and commercial activity is focused on automated approaches to security. With these approaches, security decisions are removed from the hands of the users, and are placed instead in systems themselves, or in remote services or organizations that establish policies that are automatically enforced. We contend that although security automation is potentially beneficial in theory, in practice it is not a panacea for end-user information security. A number of technical and social factors mitigate against the acceptance and efficacy of automated end-user security solutions in many cases. In this paper, we present a discussion of the inherent limitations of automating security for end-users. We then discuss a set of design guidelines for choosing whether to automate end-user security systems. We conclude with a set of research directions focused on increasing the acceptance and efficacy of security solutions for end-users.},

abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks as well as affect user behavior on social networks. This study examines the correlation between the Big Five personality traits and email phishing response. Another aspect examined is how these factors relate to users' tendency to share information and protect their privacy on Facebook (which is one of the most popular social networking sites). This research shows that when using a prize phishing email, neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email, in addition to a gender-based difference in the response. This study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, this work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users. The goal of this study is to better understand the traits that contribute to online vulnerability, for the purpose of developing customized user interfaces and secure awareness education, designed to increase users' privacy and security in the future.},

However, the drastic reduction in screen size and the accompanying reorganization of screen real-estate significantly changes the use and consistency of the security indicators and certificate information that alert users of site identity and the presence of strong cryptographic algorithms. In this paper, we perform the first measurement of the state of critical security indicators in mobile browsers. We evaluate ten mobile and two tablet browsers, representing over 90{\%} of the market share, against the recommended guidelines for web user interface to convey security set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). While desktop browsers follow the majority of guidelines, our analysis shows that mobile browsers fall significantly short. We also observe notable inconsistencies across mobile browsers when such mechanisms actually are implemented. We show where and how these failures on mobile browsers eliminate clues previously designed for, and still present in, desktop browsers to detect attacks such as phishing and man-in-the-middle. Finally, we offer advice on where current standards are unclear or incomplete.},

abstract = {The fact that a majority of Internet users appear unharmed each year is difficult to reconcile with a weakest-link analysis. We seek to explain this enormous gap between potential and actual harm. The answer, we find, lies in the fact that an Internet attacker, who attacks en masse, faces a sum-of-effort rather than a weakest-link defense. Large-scale attacks must be profitable in expectation, not merely in particular scenarios. For example, knowing the dog's name may open an occasional bank account, but the cost of determining one million users' dogs' names is far greater than that information is worth. The strategy that appears simple in isolation leads to bankruptcy in expectation. Many attacks cannot be made profitable, even when many profitable targets exist. We give several examples of insecure practices which should be exploited by a weakest-link attacker but are extremely difficult to turn into profitable attacks.},

The results are based on empirical studies of a variety of popular achievement systems. The results, along with the framework for analyzing and designing achievements, present two definitions of game achievements. From the perspective of the achievement system, an achievement appears as a challenge consisting of a signifying element, rewards and completion logics whose fulfilment conditions are defined through events in other systems (usually games). From the perspective of a single game, an achievement appears as an optional challenge provided by a meta-game that is independent of a single game session and yields possible reward(s)},

@inproceedings{Forget2015CYOA,
abstract = {To solve the long-standing problems users have in creating and re- membering text passwords, a wide variety of alternative authenti- cation schemes have been proposed. Some of these schemes out- perform others by various metrics in various contexts. However, none unilaterally outperform all others, and so text passwords per- sist as the main scheme applications depend upon. In this paper, we challenge the long-standing assumption that only one authen- tication scheme can be offered by an application service. We pro- pose Choose Your Own Authentication (CYOA); a novel authenti- cation architecture that enables users to choose a scheme amongst several available alternatives. CYOA would enable users to select whichever scheme best suits their preferences, abilities, and usage context. Existing text password systems could easily be replaced. Furthermore, the three-party architecture would enable delegating the management of authentication systems to trusted-third parties. The architecture allows rapid deployment and testing of novel au- thentication technologies. Our two-week usability study suggests that participants were willing to leverage alternative schemes. Par- ticipants were confident that CYOA could keep their financial in- formation},
address = {Twente, The Netherlands},
annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- the authors propose a system that lets the users choose their own authentication scheme.
- available schemes: Persuasive Text Passwords, Persuasive Cued Click Points, object passtiles, text passwords (baseline)

2. How did they do it?
- they conducted a small, 2 week user study with 39 participants who were prompted to log in to web sites from the MVP web-auth framework (see [5]). 

3. What was their goal?
- find evidence for/against hypotheses: h1: user do not prefer one over the other; h2: the users first take the time to learn sth about the available schemes; h3: users like CYOA

4. What are the results?
- surprise surprise: all hypotheses were confirmed. 
- users avoided Persuasive Text Password for their second account. 
- no preference of text passwords
- when people tried out a novel scheme, they switched back to text passwords and vice versa.
- users who spend more time reading the intro, were more likely to use novel schemes.
- users don't base their choice on security concerns.
- users did not switch their chosen scheme when resetting.

5. What could be improved?
- the conclusions are clearly flawed.
- the participants simply were open-minded study participants who also would behave differently in real life. 
- the statistics are traditional hypothesis tests that cannot be taken too seriously with this N
- within two weeks for artificial, uninteresting accounts it's no surprise that users did not reset their passwords / schemes. 
- the chosen schemes were all published by the authors and no one else likes them. authors were clearly biased in favor of them. 

Ah. The idea is great, but I really hate how they put it into practice and what they claim with their study. They could have done better.

abstract = {The SSL and TLS infrastructure used in important protocols like HTTPs and IMAPs is built on an X.509 public key infrastructure (PKI). X.509 certificates are thus used to authenticate services like online banking, shopping, e-mail, etc. However, it always has been felt that the certification processes of this PKI may not be con- ducted with enough rigor, resulting in a deployment where many certificates do not meet the requirements of a secure PKI. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of X.509 certifi- cates in the wild. To shed more light on the state of the deployed and actually used X.509 PKI, we obtained and evaluated data from many different sources. We conducted HTTPs scans of a large number of popular HTTPs servers over a 1.5-year time span, in- cluding scans from nine locations distributed over the globe. To compare certification properties of highly ranked hosts with the global picture, we included a third-party scan of the entire IPv4 space in our analyses. Furthermore, we monitored live SSL/TLS traffic on a 10Gbps uplink of a large research network. This allows us to compare the properties of the deployed PKI with the part of the PKI that is being actively accessed by users. Our analyses reveal that the quality of certification lacks in strin- gency, due to a number of reasons among which invalid certifica- tion chains and certificate subjects give the most cause for concern. Similar concerns can be raised for other properties of certification chains and also for many self-signed certificates used in the de- ployed X.509 PKI. Our findings confirm what has long been be- lieved namely that the X.509 PKI that we use so often in our everydays lives is in a sorry state.},

A survey was conducted online to ask users questions about the length of the password they use today, in how many web sites they use the same password, whether they use personal data while constructing their passwords and if they ever used as a password some of trivial words. They were also asked whether they reveal their password(s) to friends and/or family and if they ever realized that their password was exposed or revealed to an attacker and the measures they took after that. Additionally, an extended literature review about password habits and effectiveness regarding length and complexity is included. At the end of the paper, for first time in Greece, there is a list of the 100 passwords that Greek users should absolutely avoid using due to the ease of guessing or weak complexity, short length or simply because they exist in every dictionary used for password attacks in the wild.},

@article{Spiekermann2001,
abstract = {As electronic commerce environments become more and more interactive, privacy is a matter of increasing concern. Many surveys have investigated households' privacy attitudes and concerns, revealing a general desire among Internet users to protect their privacy. To complement these questionnaire-based studies, we conducted an experiment in which we compared self-reported privacy preferences of 171 participants with their actual disclosing behavior during an online shopping episode. Our results suggest that current approaches to protect online users' privacy, such as EU data protection regulation or P3P, may face difficulties to do so effectively. This is due to their underlying assumption that people are not only privacy conscious, but will also act accordingly. In our study, most individuals stated that privacy was important to them, with concern centering on the disclosure of different aspects of personal information. However, regardless of their specific privacy concerns, most participants did not live up to their self-reported privacy preferences. As participants were drawn into the sales dialogue with an anthropomorphic 3-D shopping bot, they answered a majority of questions, even if these were highly personal. Moreover, different privacy statements had no effect on the amount of information disclosed; in fact, the mentioning of EU regulation seemed to cause a feeling of 'false security'. The results suggest that people appreciate highly communicative EC environments and forget privacy concerns once they are ‘inside the Web'.},

abstract = {We evaluate two decades of proposals to replace text passwords for general-purpose user authentication on the web using a broad set of twenty-five usability, deployability and security benefits that an ideal scheme might provide. The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

@article{Novak2015SentimentOfEmojis,
abstract = {There is a new generation of emoticons, called emojis, that is increasingly being used in mobile communications and social media. In the past two years, over ten billion emojis were used on Twitter. Emojis are Unicode graphic symbols, used as a shorthand to express concepts and ideas. In contrast to the small number of well-known emoticons that carry clear emotional contents, there are hundreds of emojis. But what are their emotional contents? We provide the first emoji sentiment lexicon, called the Emoji Sentiment Ranking, and draw a sentiment map of the 751 most frequently used emojis. The sentiment of the emojis is computed from the sentiment of the tweets in which they occur. We engaged 83 human annotators to label over 1.6 million tweets in 13 European languages by the sentiment polarity (negative, neutral, or positive). About 4{\%} of the annotated tweets contain emojis. The sentiment analysis of the emojis allows us to draw several interesting conclusions. It turns out that most of the emojis are positive, especially the most popular ones. The sentiment distribution of the tweets with and without emojis is significantly different. The inter-annotator agreement on the tweets with emojis is higher. Emojis tend to occur at the end of the tweets, and their sentiment polarity increases with the distance. We observe no significant differences in the emoji rankings between the 13 languages and the Emoji Sentiment Ranking. Consequently, we propose our Emoji Sentiment Ranking as a European language-independent resource for automated sentiment analysis. Finally, the paper provides a formalization of sentiment and a novel visualization in the form of a sentiment bar.},

abstract = {Despite the demonstrated benefits of bimanual interaction, most tablets use just one hand for interaction, to free the other for support. In a preliminary study, we identified five holds that permit simultaneous support and interaction, and noted that users frequently change position to combat fatigue. We then designed the BiTouch design space, which introduces a support function in the kinematic chain model for interacting with hand-held tablets, and developed BiPad, a toolkit for creating bimanual tablet interaction with the thumb or the fingers of the supporting hand. We ran a controlled experiment to explore how tablet orientation and hand position affect three novel techniques: bimanual taps, gestures and chords. Bimanual taps outperformed our one-handed control condition in both landscape and portrait orientations; bimanual chords and gestures in portrait mode only; and thumbs outperformed fingers, but were more tiring and less stable. Together, BiTouch and BiPad offer new opportunities for designing bimanual interaction on hand-held tablets.},

While these warn- ings often appear in benign situations, they can also signal a man-in-the-middle attack. We conducted a survey of over 400 Internet users to examine their reactions to and understanding of current SSL warn- ings. We then designed two new warnings using warn- ings science principles and lessons learned from the survey. We evaluated warnings used in three pop- ular web browsers and our two warnings in a 100- participant, between-subjects laboratory study. Our warnings performed significantly better than exist- ing warnings, but far too many participants exhibited dangerous behavior in all warning conditions. Our re- sults suggest that, while warnings can be improved, a better approach may be to minimize the use of SSL warnings altogether by blocking users from making unsafe connections and eliminating warnings in be- nign situations.},

abstract = {Challenging the conventional wisdom that users cannot remember cryptographically-strong secrets, we test the hypothesis that users can learn randomly-assigned 56- bit codes (encoded as either 6 words or 12 characters) through spaced repetition. We asked remote research participants to perform a distractor task that required log- ging into a website 90 times, over up to two weeks, with a password of their choosing. After they entered their chosen password correctly we displayed a short code (4 letters or 2 words, 18.8 bits) that we required them to type. For subsequent logins we added an increasing de- lay prior to displaying the code, which participants could avoid by typing the code from memory. As participants learned, we added two more codes to comprise a 56.4- bit secret. Overall, 94{\%} of participants eventually typed their entire secret from memory, learning it after a me- dian of 36 logins. The learning component of our system added a median delay of just 6.9 s per login and a to- tal of less than 12 minutes over an average of ten days. 88{\%} were able to recall their codes exactly when asked at least three days later, with only 21{\%} reporting having written their secret down. As one participant wrote with surprise, “the words are branded into my brain.” While our study is preliminary in nature, we believe it debunks the myth that users are inherently incapable of remem- bering cryptographically-strong secrets for a select few high-stakes scenarios, such as a password for enterprise login or as a master key to protect other credentials (e.g., in a password manager).},

PSV can be seen as a reconfigurable " box " containing different proactive password checkers (PPCs) and visualizers of password security information, allowing it to be used like a " many in one " or " hy-brid " PPC. PSV can provide many new features that do not exist in traditional PPCs, thus having a greater potential to achieve its goals of educating users. Using purely client-side Web-based technologies, we implemented a prototype of PSV as an open-source software tool on a 2-D animated canvas. To evaluate the actual performance of our imple-mented PSV prototype against traditional PPCs, we conducted a semi-structured interview involving 20 human participants. Our qualitative analysis of the results showed that PSV was considered the most in-formative and recommended by most participants as a good educational tool. To the best of our knowledge, PSV is the first system combining dif-ferent PPCs together for user education, and the user study is the first of this kind on comparing educational effectiveness of different PPCs (and PPC-like password security tools such as PSV).},

@inproceedings{Bard2007Passphrases,
abstract = {It is well understood that passwords must be very long and complex to have sufficient entropy for secu- rity purposes. Unfortunately, these passwords tend to be hard to memorize, and so alternatives are sought. Smart Cards, Biometrics, and Reverse Turing Tests (human-only solvable puzzles) are options, but an- other option is to use pass-phrases. This paper explores methods for making pass- phrases suitable for use with password-based authen- tication and key-exchange (PAKE) protocols, and in particular, with schemes resilient to server-file compromise. In particular, the $\Omega$-method of Gen- try, MacKenzie and Ramzan, is combined with the Bellovin-Merritt protocol to provide mutual authen- tication (in the random oracle model (Canetti, Gol- dreich {\&} Halevi 2004, Bellare, Boldyreva {\&} Palacio 2004, Maurer, Renner {\&} Holenstein 2004)). Further- more, since common password-related problems are typographical errors, and the CAPSLOCK key, we show how a dictionary can be used with the Damerau- Levenshtein string-edit distance metric to construct a case-insensitive pass-phrase system that can tolerate zero, one, or two spelling-errors per word, with no loss in security. Furthermore, we show that the sys- tem can be made to accept pass-phrases that have been arbitrarily reordered, with a security cost that can be calculated. While a pass-phrase space of 2128 is not achieved by this scheme, sizes in the range of 252 to 2112 result from various selections of parameter sizes. An at- tacker who has acquired the server-file must exhaust over this space, while an attacker without the server- file cannot succeed with non-negligible probability.},

@inproceedings{Conklin2004PWAuthenticationSystemPerspective,
abstract = {User authentication in computer systems has been a cornerstone of computer security for decades. The concept of a user id and password is a cost effective and efficient method of maintaining a shared secret between a user and a computer system. One of the key elements in the password solution for security is a reliance on human cognitive ability to remember the shared secret. In early computing days with only a few computer systems and a small select group of users, this model proved effective. With the advent of the Internet, e-commerce, and the proliferation of PCs in offices and schools, the user base has grown both in number and in demographic base. Individual users no longer have single passwords for single systems, but are presented with the challenge of remembering numerous passwords for numerous systems, from email, to web accounts, to banking and financial services. This paper presents a conceptual model depicting how users and systems work together in this function and examines the consequences of the expanding user base and the use of password memory aids. A system model of the risks associated with password-based authentication is presented from a user centric point of view including the construct of user password memory aids. When confronted with too much data to remember, users develop memory aids to assist them in the task of remembering important pieces of information. These user password memory aids form a bridge between otherwise unconnected systems and have an effect on system level security across multiple systems interconnected by the user. A preliminary analysis of the implications of this user centric interconnection of security models is presented.},

These mechanisms have had little evaluation to determine how easily they are noticed and how effectively they are used. This paper describes a preliminary study conducted to determine which elements are noted, which are ignored, and how easily they are found. We collected eyetracker data to study user's attention to browser security, and gathered additional subjective data through questionnaires. Our results demonstrated that while the lock icon is commonly viewed, its interactive capability is essentially ignored. We also found that certificate information is rarely used, and that people stop looking for security information after they have signed into a site. These initial results provide insights into how browser security cues might be improved.},

@inproceedings{Kelley2012GuessAgain,
abstract = {Text-based passwords remain the dominant authentication method in computer systems, despite significant advancement in attackers' capabilities to perform password cracking. In response to this threat, password composition policies have grown increasingly complex. However, there is insufficient research defining metrics to characterize password strength and using them to evaluate password-composition policies. In this paper, we analyze 12,000 passwords collected under seven composition policies via an online study. We develop an efficient distributed method for calculating how effectively several heuristic password-guessing algorithms guess passwords. Leveraging this method, we investigate (a) the resistance of passwords created under different conditions to guessing, (b) the performance of guessing algorithms under different training sets, (c) the relationship between passwords explicitly created under a given composition policy and other passwords that happen to meet the same requirements, and (d) the relationship between guess ability, as measured with password-cracking algorithms, and entropy estimates. Our findings advance understanding of both password-composition policies and metrics for quantifying password security.},

Despite their limited capacity for approximating real human mobility, synthetic movement models are traditionally used for this purpose. More realistic simulations can be achieved by using real-life movement data, gathered by observing people in the desired context. This paper presents a method for tracking people at mass events without the need for active cooperation by the subjects. The mechanism works by scanning at multiple locations for packets sent out by the Wi-Fi interface on visitors' smartphones, and correlating the data captured at these different locations. The proposed method can be implemented at very low cost on Raspberry Pi computers. This implementation was trialed in two different contexts: a popular music festival and a university campus. The method allows for tracking thousands of people simultaneously, and achieves a higher coverage rate than similar methods for involuntary crowd tracking. Moreover, the coverage rate is expected to increase even further as more people will start using smartphones. The proposed method has many applications in different domains. It also entails privacy implications that must be considered when deploying a similar system.},

abstract = {The present model outlines the mechanisms underlying habitual control of responding and the ways in which habits interface with goals. Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between responses and the features of performance contexts that have historically covaried with them (e.g., physical settings, preceding actions). Once a habit is formed, perception of contexts triggers the associated response without a mediating goal. Nonetheless, habits interface with goals. Constraining this interface, habit associations accrue slowly and do not shift appreciably with current goal states or infrequent counterhabitual responses. Given these constraints, goals can (a) direct habits by motivating repetition that leads to habit formation and by promoting exposure to cues that trigger habits, (b) be inferred from habits, and (c) interact with habits in ways that preserve the learned habit associations. Finally, the authors outline the implications of the model for habit change, especially for the self-regulation of habit cuing.},

@article{Kahneman2003MapsOfBoundedRationality,
abstract = {Economists often criticize psychological research for its propensity to generate lists of errors and biases, and for its failure to offer a coherent alternative to the rational-agent model. The present treatment distinguishes two modes of thinking and deciding, which correspond roughly to the everyday concepts of reasoning and intuition. In the examples discussed, intuition was associated with poor performance, but intuitive thinking can also be powerful and accurate. A defining property of intuitive thoughts is that they come to mind spontaneously, like percepts. The evaluation of stimuli as good or bad is a particularly important natural assessment. A general property of perceptual systems is that they are designed to enhance the accessibility of changes and differences. Perception is reference-dependent: the perceived attributes of a focal stimulus reflect the contrast between that stimulus and a context of prior and concurrent stimuli. The assumption that preferences are not affected by inconsequential variations in the description of outcomes has been called extensionality and invariance, and is considered an essential aspect of rationality.},

@article{Tuch2012IsBeautiful,
abstract = {This paper analyzes the relation between usability and aesthetics. In a laboratory study, 80 participants used one of four different versions of the same online shop, differing in interface-aesthetics (low vs. high) and interface-usability (low vs. high). Participants had to find specific items and rate the shop before and after usage on perceived aesthetics and perceived usability, which were assessed using four validated instruments. Results show that aesthetics does not affect perceived usability. In contrast, usability has an effect on post-use perceived aesthetics. Our findings show that the "what is beautiful is usable" notion, which assumes that aesthetics enhances the perception of usability can be reversed under certain conditions (here: strong usability manipulation combined with a medium to large aesthetics manipulation). Furthermore, our results indicate that the user's affective experience with the usability of the shop might serve as a mediator variable within the aesthetics-usability relation: The frustration of poor usability lowers ratings on perceived aesthetics. The significance of the results is discussed in context of the existing research on the relation between aesthetics and usability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Cyber security systems encourage users to employ strong passwords often by increasing requirements. Unfortunately, using a strong password re- quires more cognitive effort. This increase in effort pushes users to find worka- rounds that directly harm security. The paradox between security and usability has often resulted in simply blaming users rather than seeking a Human- Centered Design perspective. We introduce a strategy for developing strong passwords that embed contextual cues within mnemonic phrase passwords.

abstract = {While the growth of business-to-consumer electronic commerce seems phenomenal in recent years, several studies suggest that a large number of individuals using the Internet have serious privacy concerns, and that winning public trust is the primary hurdle to continued growth in e-commerce. This research investigated the relative importance, when purchasing goods and services over the Web, of four common trust indices (i.e. (1) third party privacy seals, (2) privacy statements, (3) third party security seals, and (4) security features). The results indicate consumers valued security features significantly more than the three other trust indices. We also investigated the relationship between these trust indices and the consumer's perceptions of a marketer's trustworthiness. The findings indicate that consumers' ratings of trustworthiness of Web merchants did not parallel experts' evaluation of sites' use of the trust indices. This study also examined the extent to which consumers are willing to provide private information to electronic and land merchants. The results revealed that when making the decision to provide private information, consumers rely on their perceptions of trustworthiness irrespective of whether the merchant is electronic only or land and electronic. Finally, we investigated the relative importance of three types of Web attributes: security, privacy and pleasure features (convenience, ease of use, cosmetics). Privacy and security features were of lesser importance than pleasure features when considering consumers' intention to purchase. A discussion of the implications of these results and an agenda for future research are provided.},

Subjects were either made self-aware (seated in front of a mirror listening to their own tape-recorded voice) or nonself-aware (seated to the side of the mirror listening to another's voice) and were given an opportunity to cheat on an anagrams test. Significantly more cheated in the nonself-aware condition (71{\%}) than in the self-aware condition (7{\%}). The results support the basic premise of deindividuation theory that self-awareness influences impulsive, counternormative behavior and suggest that an integration of the theories of deindividuation and objective self-awareness is possible.},

abstract = {Sina Weibo, China's most popular microblogging platform, is currently used by over {\$}500M{\$} users and is considered to be a proxy of Chinese social life. In this study, we contrast the discussions occurring on Sina Weibo and on Chinese language Twitter in order to observe two different strands of Chinese culture: people within China who use Sina Weibo with its government imposed restrictions and those outside that are free to speak completely anonymously. We first propose a simple ad-hoc algorithm to identify topics of Tweets and Weibo. Different from previous works on micro-message topic detection, our algorithm considers topics of the same contents but with different $\backslash${\#}tags. Our algorithm can also detect topics for Tweets and Weibos without any $\backslash${\#}tags. Using a large corpus of Weibo and Chinese language tweets, covering the period from January {\$}1{\$} to December {\$}31{\$}, {\$}2012{\$}, we obtain a list of topics using clustered $\backslash${\#}tags that we can then use to compare the two platforms. Surprisingly, we find that there are no common entries among the Top {\$}100{\$} most popular topics. Furthermore, only {\$}9.2\backslash{\%}{\$} of tweets correspond to the Top {\$}1000{\$} topics on Sina Weibo platform, and conversely only {\$}4.4\backslash{\%}{\$} of weibos were found to discuss the most popular Twitter topics. Our results reveal significant differences in social attention on the two platforms, with most popular topics on Sina Weibo relating to entertainment while most tweets corresponded to cultural or political contents that is practically non existent in Sina Weibo.},

In three experiments, the authors show that consumers who pay a discounted price for a product (e.g., an energy drink thought to increase mental acuity) may derive less actual benefit from consuming this product (e.g., they are able to solve fewer puzzles) than consumers who purchase and consume the exact same product but pay its regular price. The studies consistently support the role of expectancies in mediating this placebo effect.

abstract = {Much has changed since the first EDITION of humancomputer interaction was published. Ubiquitous computing and rich sensor-filled environments are finding their way out of the laboratory, not just into movies but also into our workplaces and homes. The computer has broken out of its plastic and glass bounds providing us with networked societies where personal computing devices from mobile phones to smart cards fill our pockets and electronic devices surround us at home and work. The web too has grown from a largely academic network into the hub of business and everyday lives. As the distinctions between the physical and the digital, and between work and leisure start to break down, human-computer interaction is also changing radically. The excitement of these changes is captured in this new EDITION, which also looks forward to other emerging technologies. However, the book is firmly rooted in strong principles and models indepENDent of the passing technologies of the day: these foundations will be the means by which today's students will understand tomorrow's technology. The third EDITION of humancomputer interaction can be used for introductory and advanced courses on HCI, Interaction Design, Usability or Interactive Systems Design. It will also prove an invaluable reference for professionals wishing to design usable computing devices.

abstract = {Today's Internet services rely heavily on text-based passwords for user authentication. The pervasiveness of these services coupled with the difficulty of remembering large numbers of secure passwords tempts users to reuse passwords at multiple sites. In this paper, we investigate for the first time how an attacker can leverage a known password from one site to more easily guess that user's password at other sites. We study several hundred thousand leaked passwords from eleven web sites and conduct a user survey on password reuse; we estimate that 43- 51{\%} of users reuse the same password across multiple sites. We further identify a few simple tricks users often employ to transform a basic password between sites which can be used by an attacker to make password guessing vastly easier. We develop the first cross-site password-guessing algorithm, which is able to guess 30{\%} of transformed passwords within 100 attempts compared to just 14{\%} for a standard password-guessing algorithm without cross-site password knowledge.},

As long as beauty and goodness stress the subjective valuation of a product, both were related to each other.However, the nature of goodness and beauty was found to differ. Goodness depended on both perceived usability and hedonic attributes. Especially after using the skins, perceived usability be- came a strong determinant of goodness. In contrast, beauty largely depended on identification; a hedonic attribute group, which captures the product's ability to communicate important personal values to relevant others. Per- ceived usability as well as goodness was affected by experience (i.e., actual us- ability, usability problems), whereas hedonic attributes and beauty remained stable over time. All in all, the nature of beauty is rather self-oriented than goal-oriented, whereas goodness relates to both.},

To meet the need for a very brief measure, 5 and 10-item inventories were developed and evaluated. Although somewhat inferior to standard multi-item instruments, the instruments reached adequate levels in terms of: (a) convergence with widely used Big-Five measures in self, observer, and peer reports, (b) test-retest reliability, (c) patterns of predicted external correlates, and (d) convergence between self and observer ratings. On the basis of these tests, a 10-item measure of the Big-Five dimensions is offered for situations where very short measures are needed, personality is not the primary topic of interest, or researchers can tolerate the somewhat diminished psychometric properties associated with very brief measures. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

@article{Gilbert1995CorrespondenceBias,
abstract = {The correspondence bias is the tendency to draw inferences about a person's unique and enduring dispositions from behaviors that can be entirely explained by the situations in which they occur. Although this tendency is one of the most fundamental phenomena in social psychology, its causes and consequences remain poorly understood. This article sketches an intellectual history of the correspondence bias as an evolving problem in social psychology, describes 4 mechanisms (lack of awareness, unrealistic expectations, inflated categorizations, and incomplete corrections) that produce distinct forms of correspondence bias, and discusses how the consequences of correspon-dence-biased inferences may perpetuate such inferences. One will seldom go wrong if one attributes extreme actions to van-ity, average ones to habit, and petty ones to fear. (Friedrich Nietzsche, 1886/1984, p. 59) Despite the homilies of philosophers, no one has yet found a simple formula for understanding others. The problem, of course, is that a person's inner self is hidden from view. Charac-ter, motive, belief, desire, and intention play leading roles in people's construal of others, and yet none of these constructs can actually be observed. As such, people are forced into the difficult business of inferring these intangibles from that which is, in fact, observable: other people's words and deeds. When one infers the invisible from the visible, one risks making a mis-take. Three decades of research in social psychology have shown that many of the mistakes people make are of a kind: When people observe behavior, they often conclude that the person who performed the behavior was predisposed to do so—that the person's behavior corresponds to the person's unique disposi-tions—and they draw such conclusions even when a logical analysis suggests they should not. In this article, we describe the causes and consequences of this particular mistake, which we call the correspondence bias. We do not attempt a complete review of the voluminous litera-ture on this topic. Rather, we first define the correspondence},

@inproceedings{Herley2009SoLongThanksExternalities,
abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100{\%} of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01{\%} of them a modest annual pain.},

@article{Tymula30092013,
abstract = {It has long been known that human cognitive function improves through young adulthood and then declines across the later life span. Here we examined how decision-making function changes across the life span by measuring risk and ambiguity attitudes in the gain and loss domains, as well as choice consistency, in an urban cohort ranging in age from 12 to 90 y. We identified several important age-related patterns in decision making under uncertainty: First, we found that healthy elders between the ages of 65 and 90 were strikingly inconsistent in their choices compared with younger subjects. Just as elders show profound declines in cognitive function, they also show profound declines in choice rationality compared with their younger peers. Second, we found that the widely documented phenomenon of ambiguity aversion is specific to the gain domain and does not occur in the loss domain, except for a slight effect in older adults. Finally, extending an earlier report by our group, we found that risk attitudes across the life span show an inverted U-shaped function; both elders and adolescents are more risk-averse than their midlife counterparts. Taken together, these characterizations of decision-making function across the life span in this urban cohort strengthen the conclusions of previous reports suggesting a profound impact of aging on cognitive function in this domain.},

@inproceedings{Herley2008ProfitlessEndeavor,
abstract = {Conventional wisdom is that phishing represents easy money. In this paper we examine the economics that underly the phenomenon, and find a very different pic- ture. Phishing is a classic example of tragedy of the commons, where there is open access to a resource that has limited ability to regenerate. Since each phisher in- dependently seeks to maximize his return, the resource is over-grazed and yields far less than it is capable of. The situation stabilizes only when the average phisher is making only as much as he gives up in opportunity cost. Since the picture we paint is at variance with accepted wisdom we check against several publicly available data sources on phishing. We find the oft-quoted survey- based estimates of phishing losses unreliable. In par- ticular the victimization rate found in most surveys is smaller than the margin of error, and dollar losses are estimated by averaging unverified self-reported num- bers. We estimate that recent public estimates over- state phishing losses by as much as a factor of fifty. This economic portrait illuminates our enemy in an entirely new light. Far from being a path to riches, phishing appears to be a low-skill low-reward business. The enormous amount of phishing activity is evidence of its failure to deliver riches rather than its success, as phishers send more and more email hoping for their share of the bounty that eludes them. Repetition of questionable survey results and unsubstantiated anec- dotes makes things worse by ensuring a steady supply of new entrants.},

abstract = {Mobile browsers are increasingly being relied upon to perform secu- rity sensitive operations. Like their desktop counterparts, these applications can enable SSL/TLS to provide strong security guarantees for communications over the web. However, the drastic reduction in screen size and the accompanying re- organization of screen real estate significantly changes the use and consistency of the security indicators and certificate information that alert users of site identity and the presence of strong cryptographic algorithms. In this paper,we performthe first measurement of the state of critical security indicators in mobile browsers. We evaluate ten mobile and two tablet browsers, representing over 90{\%} of the market share, using the recommended guidelines for web user interface to con- vey security set forth by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). While desk- top browsers follow the majority of guidelines, our analysis shows that mobile browsers fall significantly short. We also observe notable inconsistencies across mobile browsers when such mechanisms actually are implemented. Finally, we use this evidence to argue that the combination of reduced screen space and an independent selection of security indicators not only make it difficult for experts to determine the security standing of mobile browsers, but actually make mo- bile browsing more dangerous for average users as they provide a false sense of security.},

@inproceedings{Stobert2015ExpertPassword,
address = {Cambridge, UK},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (Expert Password Management - Stobert, Elizabeth; Biddle, Robert)

1. What did the authors do?
- try to understand the password coping strategies of expert users (security experts)

2. How did they do it?
- semi-structured interviews (30 minutes), just like Password-Life cycle paper
- invitation from the group and few from the community
- no money paid to participants. 

3. What was their goal?
- give recommendations to non-expert users based on what the experts do
- identify flaws in experts' password management
- understand why certain strategies are preferable

4. What are the results?
- experts are more likely to use password managers
- password managers are mostly used for valuable accounts
- experts see password managers as cumbersome and an additional burden
- experts show consistency in their strategies
- experts also reuse passwords and write them down
- users write down passwords that they do not need often (so no interference effects!)
- experts have a lot more accounts that non-experts
- creative password creation strategies (experts can clearly communicate their algorithms)
- experts plan for failure (eg. don't use symbols or long passwords, in case they have to enter them on mobiles)
- risk assessment is highly personal and subjective
- there is a misconception that people think that only they have a certain password strategy.

5. What could be improved?
- understand individual motivation (biases) --{\textgreater} personalized strategies
- recruit at a conference instead of the own group
- boost ecological validity. show passwords and then ask "which password resembles your own email password the most? why?"

abstract = {Password patterns, as used on current Android phones, and other shape-based authentication schemes are highly usable and memorable. In terms of security, they are rather weak since the shapes are easy to steal and reproduce. In this work, we introduce an implicit authentication approach that en-hances password patterns with an additional security layer, transparent to the user. In short, users are not only authenti-cated by the shape they input but also by the way they per-form the input. We conducted two consecutive studies, a lab and a long-term study, using Android applications to collect and log data from user input on a touch screen of standard commercial smartphones. Analyses using dynamic time warping (DTW) provided first proof that it is actually possi-ble to distinguish different users and use this information to increase security of the input while keeping the convenience for the user high.},

First, the crowd is segmented into components of homogeneous motion, using the mixture of dynamic textures motion model. Second, a set of simple holistic features is extracted from each segmented region, and the correspondence between features and the number of people per segment is learned with Gaussian process regression. We validate both the crowd segmentation algorithm, and the crowd counting system, on a large pedestrian dataset (2000 frames of video, containing 49,885 total pedestrian instances). Finally, we present results of the system running on a full hour of video.},

@inproceedings{Bentley2015Phonebook,
abstract = {Over the past decade, the mobile phonebook has evolved from a relatively short list of people that one calls and texts to a many-hundred person list of aggregated contacts from around the web. This is happening at a time when an increasing number of mobile applications are relying on the mobile phonebook to create one's social network in their services. Through a large-scale study of the phonebooks of 200 diverse participants, containing 65,940 contacts, we set out to understand today's mobile contact lists. Our participants reported that they did not recognize the names of 29{\%} of their contacts and we found that the most frequently contacted five contacts represent greater than 80{\%} of all calls and text messages with phonebook contacts. We conclude with implications for the design of mobile applications that rely on phonebook data.},

@inproceedings{Paiva2017Passfault,
abstract = {Most intelligent systems need a reliable authentication method in order to assure the security of sensitive information and devices, and vulnerable combinations of username and password make it easy for devices and accounts to be compromised by attackers. Big corporations have had their databases stolen, leaving millions of accounts compromised. Although many systems encourage users to select good passwords by enforcing policies, modern cracking techniques have proved such strategies to be insufficient. Along with easily guessable passwords, password reutilization is a common practice among average users, which might lead to a wide range of social engineering and privilege escalation techniques. An accurate evaluation of a password's resistance to being cracked has proved to be a critical challenge. This paper describes Passfault, which is an Open Source tool maintained by OWASP that poses as a promising method of making sure passwords will not be cracked. A solid mathematical foundation is presented, and Passfault's results over the famous password list RockYou are described. Then, the most popular password rules found in the list are used to simulate an attack against a recently leaked hash list, providing statistical insight about how corporations and users are managing their passwords},

Forty-five males and 27 females, differing in extraversion and neuroticism, rated the frequency with which they use each of 12 main Internet services. An exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors of Internet services: social services; information services; and leisure services. Extraversion and neuroticism showed different patterns of relationships with the factors of the Internet-Services Scale, with different patterns of association for men and women. For men, extraversion was positively related to the use of leisure services and neuroticism was negatively related to information services, whereas for women, extraversion was negatively related and neuroticism positively related to the use of social services. Implications for the study of the psychological influences of the Internet are discussed.},

abstract = {Phishing attacks, in which criminals lure Internet users to Web sites that spoof legitimate Web sites, are occurring with increasing frequency and are causing considerable harm to victims. While a great deal of effort has been devoted to solving the phishing problem by prevention and detection of phishing emails and phishing Web sites, little research has been done in the area of training users to recognize those attacks. Our research focuses on educating users about phishing and helping them make better trust decisions. We identified a number of challenges for end-user security education in general and anti-phishing education in particular: users are not motivated to learn about security; for most users, security is a secondary task; it is difficult to teach people to identify security threats without also increasing their tendency to misjudge nonthreats as threats. Keeping these challenges in mind, we developed an email-based anti-phishing education system called “PhishGuru” and an online game called “Anti-Phishing Phil” that teaches users how to use cues in URLs to avoid falling for phishing attacks. We applied learning science instructional principles in the design of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil. In this article we present the results of PhishGuru and Anti-Phishing Phil user studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools. Our results suggest that, while automated detection systems should be used as the first line of defense against phishing attacks, user education offers a complementary approach to help people better recognize fraudulent emails and websites.},

We report on the experience in a 500-person organization on the security of each user's Lotus Notes client against unsigned active content.

However, we found that when presented with a choice during their workflow, many of those otherwise secured users would allow unsigned active content to run.

@inproceedings{Yang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity,
abstract = {Text-based passwords continue to be the prime form of authentication to computer systems. Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile text entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to traditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable security: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password security. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using a different text entry method. Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and probabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed cracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect of text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental groups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password than the control group ({\$}t(60) = 2.99, p = 0.004{\$}). The choices for character types in each group were also significantly different ({\$}p=0.048, FET{\$}). Our cracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across groups ({\$}p=0.031, FET{\$}) and text entry method vulnerabilities. Our findings contribute to the understanding of password security in the context of usable interfaces.},

abstract = {Home computers are frequently the target of malicious attackers because they are usually administered by non-experts. Prior work has found that users who make security decisions about their home computers often possess different mental models of information security threats, and use those mental models to make decisions about security. Using a survey, we asked a large representative sample of United States Internet users about different causal beliefs related to computer security, and about the actions they regularly undertake to protect their computers. We found demographic differences in both beliefs about security and security behaviors that pose challenges for helping users become more informed about security. Many participants reported weakly held beliefs about viruses and hackers, and these were the least likely to say they take protective actions. These results suggest that all security knowledge is not the same, educating users about security is not simply a more-is-better issue, and not all users should receive the same messages.},

In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

Password managers offer some improvement without requiring server-side changes. In this paper, we evaluate the security of dual-possession authentication, an authentication approach offering encrypted storage of passwords and theft-resistance without the use of a master password. We further introduce Tapas, a concrete implementation of dual-possession authentication leveraging a desktop computer and a smartphone. Tapas requires no server-side changes to websites, no master password, and protects all the stored passwords in the event either the primary or secondary device (e.g., computer or phone) is stolen. To evaluate the viability of Tapas as an alternative to traditional password managers, we perform a 30 participant user study comparing Tapas to two configurations of Firefox's built-in password manager. We found users significantly preferred Tapas. We then improve Tapas by incorporating feedback from this study, and reevaluate it with an additional 10 participants. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Today's operating systems of mobile devices offer authentication mechanisms. However, they are either vulnerable in some situations or not user friendly enough to be widely adopted. In this paper we suggest a novel authentication system which meets both the requirements of security and usability. For that purpose, we have analyzed existing authentication methods as well as targeting attacks. The resulting Android application SecureLock is a generic authentication system, which offers PIN and password, but also a property-based authentication method by means of NFC tags, and a novel image-based method called GesturePuzzle. The application has been evaluated and compared with other approaches for security and usability.},

@inproceedings{Dhamija2005DynamicSecuritySkins,
abstract = {Phishing is a model problem for illustrating usability concerns of privacy and security because both system designers and attackers battle using user interfaces to guide (or misguide) users. We propose a new scheme, Dynamic Security Skins, that allows a remote web server to prove its identity in a way that is easy for a human user to verify and hard for an attacker to spoof. We describe the design of an extension to the Mozilla Firefox browser that implements this scheme. We present two novel interaction techniques to prevent spoofing. First, our browser extension provides a trusted window in the browser dedicated to username and password entry. We use a photographic image to create a trusted path between the user and this window to prevent spoofing of the window and of the text entry fields. Second, our scheme allows the remote server to generate a unique abstract image for each user and each transaction. This image creates a “skin” that automatically customizes the browser window or the user interface elements in the content of a remote web page. Our extension allows the user's browser to independently compute the image that it expects to receive from the server. To authenticate content from the server, the user can visually verify that the images match. We contrast our work with existing anti-phishing proposals. In contrast to other proposals, our scheme places a very low burden on the user in terms of effort, memory and time. To authenticate himself, the user has to recognize only one image and remember one low entropy password, no matter how many servers he wishes to interact with. To authenticate content from an authenticated server, the user only needs to perform one visual matching operation to compare two images. Furthermore, it places a high burden of effort on an attacker to spoof customized security indicators.},

Passphrases, space-delimited sets of natural language words, have been sug- gested as both secure and usable for decades. In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3- and 4-word system- assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system- assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

These advances bring privacy concerns: online social data is more accessible and persistent and simultaneously less contextualized than traditional social interactions. To allay these concerns, many web services allow users to configure their privacy settings based on a set of multiple-choice questions.We suggest a new paradigm for privacy options. Instead of suggesting the same defaults to each user, services can leverage knowledge of users' traits to recommend a machine-learned prediction of their privacy preferences for Facebook. As a case study, we build and evaluate MyPrivacy, a publicly available web application that suggests personalized privacy settings. An evaluation with 199 users shows that users find the suggestions to be appropriate and private; furthermore, they express intent to implement the recommendations made by MyPrivacy. This supports the proposal to put personalization to work in online communities to promote privacy and security.},

abstract = {When browsing the Internet, users are likely to be exposed to security and privacy threats – like fraudulent websites. Automatic browser mechanisms can protect them only to some extent. In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel tool for the analysis of new molecular structures which enables a wide variety of manipulations. It is composed of a molecular simulator and a haptic device. The simulation software deals with systems of hundreds or thousands of degrees of freedom and computes the reconfiguration of the molecules in a few tenths of a second. For the ease of manipulation and to help the operator understand nanoscale phenomena, a haptic device is connected to the simulator. To handle a wide variety of applications, both position and force control are implemented. To our knowledge, this is the first time the applications of force control are detailed for molecular simulation. These two control modes are compared in terms of adequacy with molecular dynamics, transparency and stability sensitivity with respect to environmental conditions. Based on their specificity the operations they can realize are detailed. Experiments highlight the usability of our tool for the different steps of the analysis of molecular structures. It includes the global reconfiguration of a molecular system, the measurement of molecular properties and the comprehension of nanoscale interactions. Compared to most existing systems, the one developed in this paper offers a wide range of possible experiments. The detailed analysis of the properties of the control modes can be easily used to implement haptic feedback on other molecular simulators.},

abstract = {The problems with passwords are well-known: secure pass- words are difficult to remember, users have too many pass- words, and users have difficulty matching their passwords to accounts. Password managers and cued graphical pass- words are two password solutions that address the issues of memorability and keeping track of of passwords. We have developed Versipass, a password manager that incorporates key elements of password managers and cued graphical pass- words to avoid existing problems of password memorabil- ity and associating passwords with accounts. Instead of re- membering passwords, Versipass remembers image cues for graphical passwords. These cues help users to better re- member their passwords and to more easily link passwords with accounts. Versipass also facilitates safe password reuse by allowing users to use the same image cue for multiple accounts.},

This paper aims to share techniques for creating and optimizing audio-haptic effects to enhance the user interface.The authors present audio manipulation techniques specific to the multifunction transducer (MFT) technology. In particular two techniques, the Haptic Inheritance and Synthesis and Matching methods are discussed. These two methods of haptic media generation allow simple creation of vibration content, and also allow for compatibility with non-haptic mobile devices.The authors present preliminary results of an evaluation of 42 participants comparing audio-based haptic user interface (UI) feedback with audio-only feedback. The results show that users were receptive to audio-haptic UI feedback. The results also suggest that audio-haptics seems to enhance the perception of audio quality.},

This relationship held true across three types of procedures for producing normative focus (physiological arousal, modeling, and self-directed attention), across two types of settings (public and private), and across two types of norms (social and personal). Moreover, factors that would be expected to affect normative action were influential only when the norm was focal. These factors included the degree to which the action violated the relevant norm (Study 2) and the degree to which an individual subscribed to that norm (Study 3). Implications are discussed for developing campaigns to encourage prosocial behavior.},

The client can now enjoy chatting, playing games and Internet banking. All these applications have something in common, they can be run on multiple platforms and in some cases they will run offline. With the introduction of HTML5 this evolution will continue, with browsers offering greater levels of functionality. This paper outlines the background study and the importance of new technologies, such as HTML5's new browser based storage called IndexedDB. We will show how the technology of storing data on the client side has changed over the time and how the technologies for storing data on the client will be used in future when considering known security issues. Further, we propose a solution to IndexedDB's known security issues in form of a security model, which will extend the current model.},

abstract = {Tapping on surfaces in a typical virtual environment feels like contact with soft foam rather than a hard object. The realism of such interactions can be dramatically improved by superimposing event-based, high-frequency transient forces over traditional position-based feedback. When scaled by impact velocity, hand-tuned pulses and decaying sinusoids produce haptic cues that resemble those experienced during real impacts. Our new method for generating appropriate transients inverts a dynamic model of the haptic device to determine the motor forces required to create prerecorded acceleration profiles at the user's fingertips. After development, the event-based haptic paradigm and the method of acceleration matching were evaluated in a carefully controlled user study. Sixteen individuals blindly tapped on nine virtual and three real samples, rating the degree to which each felt like real wood. Event-based feedback achieved significantly higher realism ratings than the traditional rendering method. The display of transient signals made virtual objects feel similar to a real sample of wood on a foam substrate, while position feedback alone received ratings similar to those of foam. This work provides an important new avenue for increasing the realism of contact in haptic interactions.},

@article{Renaud2009VisualSnakeOil,
abstract = {Users of computer systems are accustomed to being asked for passwords -- it is as universal as it is frustrating. In the past there was little tolerance for the problems experienced remembering passwords, and many users still remember, with embarrassment, having to go hat-in-hand to request a password change and being treated with disdain by a lofty administrator. Latterly there is more understanding of the problems experienced by users, especially since the "password conundrum" has reached epidemic proportions for Web users, who are asked for passwords with unrelenting predictability. The problems with passwords are clear -- users cannot remember numbers of meaningless alphanumeric strings with ease. Hence, they react by choosing simple and predictable words or numbers related to their everyday life, and engaging in insecure practices, such as writing passwords down or sharing them. These practices cause a breach affecting even the most secure and protected network system. Hence the user is often called the weakest link of the security chain, with system administrators despairing of trying to maintain security with the weak link so often reaching breaking point. Users forgetting passwords has serious economical consequences for organizations. Both academia and industry have been investigating alternatives to passwords, with varying degrees of success. One of the most well-known solutions is the biometric -- measurement of either behavioral or physiological characteristics of the end-user. This is obviously superior to the password because it removes the burden on the user's memory. So why don't we just switch to biometrics and give the poor user a break?

abstract = {In the past, research on password mechanisms has focussed almost entirely on technical issues. Only in recent years has the security research community acknowledged that user behavior plays a part in many security failures, and that policies alone may not be sufficient to ensure correct behavior. We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind. We present the results of a first study that can guide such persuasive efforts, and describe methods that can be used to persuade users to employ proper password practice.},

abstract = {To help users create stronger text-based passwords, many web sites have deployed password meters that provide visual feedback on password strength. Although these meters are in wide use, their effects on the security and usability of passwords have not been well studied. We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

This paper evaluates the effectiveness of this security practice based on the password reset email that LinkedIn sent out around May 2016, and through an online survey conducted on 249 LinkedIn users who received that email. Our evaluation shows that only about 46{\%} of the participants reset their passwords. The mean time taken to reset password was 26.3 days, revealing that a significant proportion of the participants reset their password a few weeks, or even months after first receiving the email. Our findings suggest that more effective persuasive measures need to be added to convince users to reset their password in a timely manner, and further reduce the risks associated with delaying password resets.},

@inproceedings{Forget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion,
abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions.

When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

System-assigned passwords provide measurable security but suffer from poor memorability. To address this usability-security tension, we argue that systems should assign random passwords but also help with memorization and recall. We investigate the feasibility of this approach with CuedR, a novel cued-recognition authentication scheme that provides users with multiple cues (visual, verbal, and spatial) and lets them choose the cues that best fit their learning process for later recognition of system-assigned keywords. In our lab study, all 37 of our participants could log in within three attempts one week after registration (mean login time: 38.0 seconds). A pilot study on using multiple CuedR passwords also showed 100{\%} recall within three attempts. Based on our results, we suggest appropriate applications for CuedR, such as financial and e-commerce accounts.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2015SecretsLies,
abstract = {We examine the ﬁrst large real-world data set on personal knowl- edge question's security and memorability from their deployment at Google. Our analysis conﬁrms that secret questions generally offer a security level that is far lower than user-chosen passwords. It turns out to be even lower than proxies such as the real distribution of sur- names in the population would indicate. Surprisingly, we found that a signiﬁcant cause of this insecurity is that users often don't answer truthfully. A user survey we conducted revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of users (37{\%}) who admitted to providing fake answers did so in an attempt to make them "harder to guess" although on aggregate this behavior had the opposite effect as people "harden" their answers in a predictable way. On the usability side, we show that secret answers have sur- prisingly poor memorability despite the assumption that reliability motivates their continued deployment. From millions of account re- covery attempts we observed a signiﬁcant fraction of users (e.g 40{\%} of our English-speaking US users) were unable to recall their an- swers when needed. This is lower than the success rate of alternative recovery mechanisms such as SMS reset codes (over 80{\%}). Comparing question strength and memorability reveals that the questions that are potentially the most secure (e.g what is your ﬁrst phone number) are also the ones with the worst memorability. We conclude that it appears next to impossible to ﬁnd secret questions that are both secure and memorable. Secret questions continue have some use when combined with other signals, but they should not be used alone and best practice should favor more reliable alternatives.},

abstract = {Graphical password schemes have been proposed as an alternative to text passwords in applications that support graphics and mouse or stylus entry. In this paper we detail what is, to our knowledge, the largest published empirical evaluation of the effects of user choice on the security of graphical password schemes. We show that permitting user selection of passwords in two graphical password schemes, one based directly on an existing commercial product, can yield passwords with entropy far below the theoretical optimum and, in some cases, that are highly correlated with the race or gender of the user. For one scheme, this effect is so dramatic so as to render the scheme insecure. A conclusion of our work is that graphical password schemes of the type we study may generally require a different posture toward password selection than text passwords, where selection by the user remains the norm today.},

@article{Herley2012PersistenceOfPasswords,
abstract = {Despite countless attempts and near-universal desire to replace them, passwords are more widely used and firmly entrenched than ever. The authors' exploration leads them to argue that no silver bullet will meet all requirements-not only will passwords be with us for some time, but in many instances, they're the solution that best fits the scenario of use. Among broad authentication research directions to follow, they first suggest better means to concretely identify actual requirements (surprisingly overlooked to date) and weight their relative importance in target scenarios. Second, for scenarios where passwords appear to be the best-fit solution, they suggest designing better means to support them. The authors also highlight the need for more systematic research and how the premature conclusion that passwords are dead has led to the neglect of important research questions.},

An example of each is described in detail, namely the problem of carriers competing for intercity passenger travel and the signal optimization problem. The discussion serves to underline differences between two categories of transportation problems and introduces the game theory literature as a potential source of solution algorithms. Also it is shown that inner-outer iterative techniques for Stackelberg type problems cannot be expected to converge to the solution, and an approximate formulation of these problems is introduced which appears to be more readily solvable.},

Second, a set of simple holistic features is extracted from each segmented region, and the correspondence between features and the number of people per segment is learned with Gaussian process regression. We validate both the crowd segmentation algorithm, and the crowd counting system, on a large pedestrian dataset (2000 frames of video, containing 49,885 total pedestrian instances). Finally, we present results of the system running on a full hour of video.},

Using an Ambiguous Situations Task, the findings revealed that European American children attending homogeneous schools displayed racial bias in their interpretations of ambiguous situations as well as in their evaluations of cross-race friendship. Bias was not found, however, in the interpretations and evaluations of European American or African American children from heterogeneous schools. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate significant and direct relationships between intergroup contact in the school environment and children's intergroup biases as well as judgments about the potential for cross-race friendships.},

However, during our study we observed a strong disparity between our participants actions during the laboratory tasks and their self-reported "would be" actions during similar tasks in everyday computer practices. Our participants attributed this disparity to the laboratory environment and the security it offered. In this paper we discuss our results and how the introduced changes to the initial study design may have affected them. Also, we discuss the challenges of observing natural behavior in a study environment, as well as the challenges of replicating previous studies given the rapid changes in web technology.

So too is interest in valuing the arts so that efficient funding decisions can be made by government and private sponsors. "Measuring the Value of Culture" documents the use of methods used to put a price on cultural goods, including theatre, heritage, cultural events like arts festivals, museums, archaelogical sites and libraries. The methods discussed include economic impact studies, which use market data, as well as non-market valuation techniques like willingness to pay methods and the newer choice experiments. In addition, advances in more qualitative valuation methods are considered. The book aims to give practitioners a practical guide to conducting such valuation studies, while also providing potential funders with a means of evaluating the results. The theoretical background of the various methods, their potential problems and the kind of information they can provide is also discussed.},

abstract = {In many cases students in higher education are driven by assessments and achievements rather than the " learn­ ing journey " that can be achieved through full engage­ ment with provided material. Novel approaches are needed to improve engagement in and out of class time, and to achieve a greater depth of learning. Gamification, " the use of game design elements in non­game con­ texts " , has been applied to higher education to improve engagement, and research also suggests that serious games can be used for games­based learning, providing simulated learning environments and increasing motiva­ tion. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a gami­ fied computer security module, with a unique approach to assessed learning activities. Learning activities (many developed as open educational resources (OER)) and an assessment structure were developed. A new free and open source software (FOSS) virtual learning environ­ ment (VLE) was implemented, which enables the use of three types of experience points (XP), and a semi­auto­ mated marking scheme for timely, clear, transparent, and feedback­oriented marking. The course and VLE were updated and evaluated over two years. Qualitative and descriptive results were posi­ tive and encouraging. However, ultimately the increased satisfaction was not found to have statistical signifi­ cance on quantitative measurements of motivation, and the teaching workload of the gamified module was note­ worthy.},

abstract = {HCI research published 10 years ago pointed out that many users cannot cope with the number and complexity of passwords, and resort to insecure workarounds as a consequence. We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

The amazing and constantly growing numbers of machines and users ensures that untrustworthy individuals have full access to that network. High speed inter-machine communication and even higher speed computational processors have made the threats of system “crackers”, data theft, and data corruption very real. This paper outlines some of the problems of current password security by demonstrating the ease by which individual at counts may be broken. Various techniques used by crackers are outlined, and finally one solution to this point of system vulnerability, a proactive password checker, is documented.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of organizations allowing per- sonal smart phones onto their networks, considerable secu- rity risk is introduced. The security risk is exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices and their respective installed pool of applications. Further- more, by virtue of the devices not being owned by the orga- nization, the ability to authoritatively enforce organizational security polices is challenging. As a result, a critical part of organizational security is the ability to drive user security behavior through either on-device mechanisms or security awareness programs. In this paper, we establish a base- line for user security behavior from a population of over one hundred fifty smart phone users. We then systematically evaluate the ability to drive behavioral change via messag- ing centered on morality, deterrence, and incentives. Our findings suggest that appeals to morality are most effective over time, whereas deterrence produces the most immediate reaction. Additionally, our findings show that while a sig- nificant portion of users are securing their devices without prior intervention, it is difficult to influence change in those who do not.},

We present persuasion profiling as a method to personalize the persuasive messages used by a system to influence its users. This type of personalization can be based on explicit measures of users' tendencies to comply to distinct persuasive strategies: measures based on standardized questionnaire scores of users. However, persuasion profiling can also be implemented using implicit, behavioral measures of user traits. We present three case studies involving the design, implementation, and field deployment of personalized persuasive technologies, and we detail four design requirements. In each case study we show how these design requirements are implemented. In the discussion we highlight avenues for future research in the field of adaptive persuasive technologies.},

@article{Cooper2004,
abstract = {Public interest in the durability of household appliances may be traced back 40 years to criticism of planned obsolescence raised by an emerging consumer movement. A recent revival of interest in product life spans has taken place in the context of increasing waste generation and debate prompted by proposed producer responsibility legislation, but data on the age of discarded products and consumer attitudes to product life spans have been lacking. This paper draws upon recent data from research into discarded household appliances in the UK to enhance a theoretical model of product obsolescence and explore some implications for marketing and public policy. A survey of over 800 households provided quantitative data on consumer attitudes and behaviour relating to appliance life spans and a subsequent series of focus groups enriched this data with personal narratives. Respondents were evenly divided on whether or not appliance life spans are adequate. Variations in behaviour demonstrated how users may influence appliance life spans. Overall, the results suggest that consumers have an important role in reversing the trend toward increased appliance waste but currently face economic disincentives and lack adequate product information.

Our data stem from smartphones of 117 Nokia N95 smartphone users, collected over a continuous period of 17 months in Switzerland. From the analysis, we show that several aggregated features obtained from smartphone usage data can be indicators of the Big-Five traits. Next, we describe a machine learning method to detect the personality trait of a user based on smartphone usage. Finally, we study the benefits of using gender-specific models for this task. Apart from a psychological viewpoint, this study facilitates further research on the automated classification and usage of personality traits for personalizing services on smartphones.},

abstract = {False positives cause many promising detection technologies to be unworkable in practice. Attackers, we show, face this problem too. In deciding who to attack true positives are targets successfully attacked, while false positives are those that are attacked but yield nothing. This allows us to view the attacker's problem as a binary classiﬁcation. The most proﬁtable strategy requires accurately distinguishing viable from non-viable users, and balancing the relative costs of true and false positives. We show that as victim density decreases the fraction of viable users than can be proﬁtably attacked drops dramatically. For example, a 10× reduction in density can produce a 1000× reduction in the number of victims found. At very low victim densities the attacker faces a seemingly intractable Catch-22: unless he can distinguish viable from non-viable users with great accuracy the attacker cannot ﬁnd enough victims to be proﬁtable. However, only by ﬁnding large numbers of victims can he learn how to accurately distinguish the two. Finally, this approach suggests an answer to the question in the title. Far-fetched tales of West African riches strike most as comical. Our analysis suggests that is an advantage to the attacker, not a disadvantage. Since his attack has a low density of victims the Nigerian scammer has an over-riding need to reduce false positives. By sending an email that repels all but the most gullible the scammer gets the most promising marks to self-select, and tilts the true to false positive ratio in his favor.},

@article{Stieger2011,
abstract = {Today's economy depends on the secure flow of information within and across organizations and information security is an issue of vital importance. Information security ensures business continuity and minimizes business damage by preventing and reducing the impact of security incidents. However, information security efforts are certainly not as effective as one would have wished for. A commonly accepted reason for this is the insecure behaviour of people. This insecure behaviour is often due to a lack of knowledge, awareness, education and training. In order to address this, many organisations provide security education, training and awareness programs to their employees. However, these programs often do not achieve a persistent change towards secure behaviour. The various reasons that contribute to the failure of security education, training and awareness programs and cause the trend towards insecure behaviour are briefly discussed. It follows that changing the behaviour of people is an inherently difficult task that requires the consideration of many factors. Similarly, a tool that intends to address insecure behaviour needs to consider various technological elements that may contribute in its ability to influence behaviour. The aim of this paper is to propose the principles of a personal information security agent and explore a set of objectives and criteria that may contribute to its success in influencing and reminding individuals towards a more secure behaviour. The criteria stem from various domains such as persuasive technology and human computer interaction. Persuasive technology has been applied in various domains to shape, reinforce or change people's behaviour. We describe related work that has been done using persuasive technology, and build on it. The proposed criteria consists of functions such as "To motivate" and characteristics such as "Context sensitivity". To put the theory into practice, a prototype of a personal security agent has been developed that implements some of the criteria. Based on this, a discussion on the development and implementation of the prototype and its potential benefits has been included. The prototype was developed to test the proposed criteria in a practical experiment that will form part of future research.},

This study examines this intriguing idea in the context of the E-commerce involved in inquiring about and purchasing books on the Internet. Survey data from 217 potential users support and extend this hypothesis. The data show that both familiarity with an Internet vendor and its processes and trust in the vendor influenced the respondents' intentions to inquire about books, and their intentions to purchase them. Additionally, the data show that while familiarity indeed builds trust, it is primarily people's disposition to trust that affected their trust in the vendor.

abstract = {OpenID and InfoCard are two mainstream Web single sign- on (SSO) solutions intended for Internet-scale adoption. While they are technically sound, the business model of these solu- tions does not provide content-hosting and service providers (CSPs) with sucient incentives to become relying parties (RPs). In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adop- tion for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must of- fer RPs sucient business incentives and trustworthy iden- tity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks. Moreover, we propose that Web SSO technol- ogy should build identity support into browsers in order to facilitate RPs' adoption.},

abstract = {When dealing with online crimes like phishing, spam and malware, it's important to understand where the biggest threats are and what works to defeat them. The latest Global Phishing Survey, published by the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), has new data that shows where phishing has been taking place, and in some cases how and why. The report indicates that, through the later part of 2009, a single gang of phishers - the 'Avalanche' operation - was responsible for two-thirds of all phishing attacks launched on the Internet. Greg Aaron, a director at Afilias, analyses the activities of the Avalanche group and asks what they tell us about the state of phishing today. Famous old-time bank robber Willie Sutton said, "Go where the money is ... and go there often". And that's what today's e-criminals are doing - they're going where the money is, and with startling frequency. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To investigate this hypothesis, we carried out a controlled study with 2,482 participants who interpreted emoji both in isolation and in multiple textual contexts. After comparing the variability of emoji interpreta-tion in each condition, we found that our results do not sup-port the hypothesis in prior work: when emoji are interpreted in textual contexts, the potential for miscommunication ap-pears to be roughly the same.

Prior literature diverges on how people's Internet knowledge affects their privacy and security decisions. We undertook a qualitative study to understand what people do and do not know about the Internet and how that knowledge affects their responses to privacy and security risks. Lay people, as compared to those with computer science or related backgrounds, had simpler mental models that omitted Internet levels, organizations, and entities. People with more articulated technical models perceived more privacy threats, possibly driven by their more accurate understanding of where specific risks could occur in the network. Despite these differences, we did not find a direct relationship between people's technical background and the actions they took to control their privacy or increase their security online. Consistent with other work on user knowledge and experience, our study suggests a greater emphasis on policies and systems that protect privacy and security without relying too much},

2. How did they do it?
- qualitative study with drawing tasks
- 28 participants, video recording
- coding of dimensions in which drawings differed
- divided into laymen, techical people, and sampled
from the community (older)

3. What was their goal?
- understand misconceptions about entities on the web
- understand how users perceive attack vectors

4. What are the results?
- strong differences depending on the educational background
- no IT background: simple, service oriented mental models,
- technical background: multi-layer environment with
entities and organizations.
- most often, people get more privacy sensitive by experiencing breaches or harmful activity. 
- technical background does not lead to more actions taken

- sample size with 28
- sample population is mostly students / university staff
- show all drawings
- conceptualize the mental models better (not just tables)},

abstract = {Even though users have become increasingly concerned about their privacy online, they continue to disclose deeply personal information in a number of online venues, including e-commerce portals and social networking sites. Scholars have tried to explain this inconsistency between attitudes and behavior by suggesting that online users consciously weigh the trade-off between the costs and benefits of online information disclosure. We argue that online user behaviors are not always rational, but may occur due to expedient decision-making in the heat of the moment. Such decisions are based on cognitive heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb) rather than on a careful analysis of each transaction. Based on this premise, we seek to identify the specific triggers for disclosure of private information online. In the experiment reported here, we explore the operation of two specific heuristics-benefit and fuzzy boundary-in influencing privacy-related attitudes and behaviors.

@article{Lederer2002,
abstract = {We present a unified model of everyday privacy in ubiquitous computing environments, designed to aid system designers and administrators in conceptualizing the end-user privacy experience. The model accounts for the influence of societal-scale forces, contextual factors, and subjective perception on end-user privacy. We identify notice and consent as the fair information practices of greatest everyday utility to users, as they gradually engender the users conceptual model of ubicomp privacy. Navigating the regular deluge of personal information collection events in ubicomp requires that notice be minimally intrusive and consent be implicitly granted by a persistent, situation- specific set of user preferences. We extend our model into an interactional metaphor called situational faces, designed to mitigate the complexity of privacy for the end-user. When encountering a situation, a user engages the appropriate face, a metaphorical abstraction of a set of privacy preferences.},

abstract = {A lot of research is being conducted into improving the usability and security of phone-unlocking. There is however a severe lack of scientific data on users' current unlocking behavior and perceptions. We performed an online survey (n = 260) and a one-month field study (n = 52) to gain insights into real world (un)locking behavior of smartphone users. One of the main goals was to find out how much overhead unlocking and authenticating adds to the overall phone usage and in how many unlock interactions security (i.e. authentication) was perceived as necessary. We also investigated why users do or do not use a lock screen and how they cope with smartphone-related risks, such as shouldersurfing or unwanted accesses. Among other results, we found that on average, participants spent around 2.9 {\%} of their smartphone interaction time with authenticating (9 {\%} in the worst case). Participants that used a secure lock screen like PIN or Android unlock patterns considered it unnecessary in 24.1 {\%} of situations. Shoulder surfing was perceived to be a relevant risk in only 11 of 3410 sampled situations.},

@inproceedings{Bonneau2010PasswordThicket,
abstract = {We report the results of the first large-scale empirical analysis of password implementations deployed on the Internet. Our study included 150 websites which offer free user accounts for a variety of purposes, including the most popular destinations on the web and a random sample of e-commerce, news, and communication websites. Although all sites evaluated relied on user-chosen textual passwords for authentication, we found many subtle but important technical variations in im- plementation with important security implications. Many poor practices were commonplace, such as a lack of encryption to protect transmitted passwords, storage of cleartext passwords in server databases, and little protection of passwords from brute force attacks. While a spectrum of imple- mentation quality exists with a general co-occurrence of more-secure and less-secure implementa- tion choices, we find a surprising number of inconsistent choices within individual sites, suggesting that the lack of a standards is harming security. We observe numerous ways in which the technical failures of lower-security sites can compromise higher-security sites due to the well-established ten- dency of users to re-use passwords. Our data confirms that the worst security practices are indeed found at sites with few security incentives, such as newspaper websites, while sites storing more sensitive information such as payment details or user communication implement more password se- curity. From an economic viewpoint, password insecurity is a negative externality that the market has been unable to correct, undermining the viability of password-based authentication. We also speculate that some sites deploying passwords do so primarily for psychological reasons, both as a justification for collecting marketing data and as a way to build trusted relationships with customers. This theory suggests that efforts to replace passwords with more-secure protocols or federated iden- tity systems may fail because they dont recreate the entrenched ritual of password authentication.},

@misc{Acar2016NotYourDeveloper,
abstract = {While researchers have developed many tools, techniques, and protocols for improving software security, exploits and breaches are only becoming more frequent. Some of this gap between theoretical security and actual vulnerability can be explained by insufficient consideration of human factors, broadly termed usability, when developing these mechanisms. In particular, security mechanisms may be difficult to use, may conflict with other priorities, or may assume more security knowledge than users possess. For almost 20 years, the usable security community has investigated how to improve the usability of security tools and interfaces aimed at end users. More recently, the community has begun to apply similar techniques in the context of improving security tools - such as APIs and bug-finding software - aimed not at end users but at developers, whose security errors are magnified across all users of their products. In this paper, we review key lessons learned from usable security for end users and consider how to apply them in the context of developers. We propose a research agenda aimed at developing a high-quality, comprehensive literature for usable security for developers, including: investigating how to conduct reliable research in this context, understanding developers' attitudes, knowledge, and priorities, measuring the status quo, and developing improved tools and interventions in the future.},

abstract = {Framing effects occur in a wide range of laboratory and natural decision contexts, but the underlying processes that produce framing effects are not well understood. We explored the role of working memory (WM) in framing by manipulating WM loads during risky decisions. After starting with a hypothetical stake of money, participants were then presented a lesser amount that they could keep for certain (positive frame) or lose for certain (negative frame). They made a choice between the sure amount and a gamble in which they could either keep or lose all of the original stake. On half of the trials, the choice was made while maintaining a concurrent WM load of random letters. In both load and no-load conditions, we replicated the typical finding of risk aversion with positive frames and risk seeking with negative frames. In addition, people made fewer decisions to accept the gamble under conditions of higher cognitive load. The data are congruent with a dual-process reasoning framework in which people employ a heuristic to make satisfactory decisions with minimal effort.},

Therefore protecting its security is very important and becoming a top priority for many organizations. Unfortunately there is no single formula that can guarantee 100{\%} of information security. Therefore there is a need for a set of benchmarks or standards to ensure the best security practices are adopted and an adequate level of security is attained. In this paper, authors introduce various information security standards briefly and then provide a comparative study for major information security standards, namely ISO27001, BS 7799, PCIDSS, ITIL and COBIT.

abstract = {By allowing individuals to be permanently connected to the Internet, mobile devices ease the way information can be ac- cessed and shared online, but also raise novel privacy chal- lenges for end users. Recent behavioral research on “soft” or “asymmetric” paternalism has begun exploring ways of helping people make better decisions in different aspects of their lives. We apply that research to privacy decision mak- ing, investigating how soft paternalistic solutions (also known as nudges) may be used to counter cognitive biases and ame- liorate privacy-sensitive behavior. We present the theoret- ical background of our research, and highlight current in- dustry solutions and research endeavors that could be classi- fied as nudging interventions. We then describe our ongoing work on embedding soft paternalistic mechanisms in loca- tion sharing technologies and Twitter privacy agents.},

abstract = {In this paper they create a model to explain location of check-ins in GoWall, BrightKite and Cell phone data. They create a spatial temporal model that uses mixture model to learn the density of the tweets. In the mixture model there are two components, one for work and one for home. The probability of belonging to each of the components is govern by time and then the location is govern by the spatial model learned. To add on top of that, this paper introduces a social explanation for check-ins that are not corralated with the two components. The idea is that if an individual is checking - in not according to the two components then there are social ties that explains that. To show results they compute both log-likelihood and also predictions experiments.},

Passwords remain the dominant means of authentication on the Internet, even in the face of significant problems related to password forgetting and theft. In fact, despite large numbers of proposed alternatives, we must remember more passwords than ever before. Why is this? Will alphanumeric passwords still be ubiquitous in 2019, or will adoption of alternative proposals be commonplace? What must happen in order to move beyond passwords? This note pursues these questions, following a panel discussion at Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2009.},

@inproceedings{Deblasio2017Tripwire,
abstract = {Password reuse has been long understood as a problem: credentials stolen from one site may be leveraged to gain access to another site for which they share a password. Indeed, it is broadly understood that attackers exploit this fact and routinely leverage credentials ex-tracted from a site they have breached to access high-value accounts at other sites (e.g., email accounts). However, as a consequence of such acts, this same phenomena of password reuse attacks can be harnessed to indirectly infer site compromises—even those that would otherwise be unknown. In this paper we describe such a mea-surement technique, in which unique honey accounts are registered with individual third-party websites, and thus access to an email account provides indirect evidence of credentials theft at the corre-sponding website. We describe a prototype system, called Tripwire, that implements this technique using an automated Web account registration system combined with email account access data from a major email provider. In a pilot study monitoring more than 2,300 sites over a year, we have detected 19 site compromises, including what appears to be a plaintext password compromise at an Alexa top-500 site with more than 45 million active users.},

@article{Maruna2006,
abstract = {The notion of ‘cognitive distortion' has become enshrined in the offender treatment literature over the last 20 years, yet the concept still suffers from a lack of definitional clarity. In particular, the umbrella term is often used to refer to offence-supportive attitudes, cognitive processing during an offence sequence, as well as post-hoc neutralisations or excuses for offending. Of these very different processes, the last one might be the most popular and problematic. Treatment programmes for offenders often aim to eliminate excuse-making as a primary aim, and decision-makers place great weight on the degree to which an offender “takes responsibility” for his or her offending. Yet, the relationship between these after-the-fact explanations and future crime is not at all clear. Indeed, the designation of post hoc excuses as criminogenic may itself be an example of fallacious thinking. After all, outside of the criminal context, post hoc excuse-making is widely viewed as normal, healthy, and socially rewarded behaviour. We argue that the open exploration of contextual risk factors leading to offending can help in the identification of criminogenic factors as well as strengthen the therapeutic experience. Rather than insist that offenders take “responsibility” for the past, we suggest that efforts should focus on helping them take responsibility for the future, shifting the therapeutic focus from post hoc excuses to offence-supportive attitudes and underlying cognitive schemas that are empirically linked to re-offending.},

Indeed, the fact that one of the first publications from the UK's newly-formed National Cyber Security Centre was a password infographic is a telling sign of where we currently are with password use and misuse. Passwords remain the most common form of authentication but continue to face various practical challenges, not least of which is getting users to make appropriate choices in the first place. Steven Furnell and Rawan Esmael of the University of Plymouth conducted a series of experiments to assess users' password creation behaviour with varying levels of support, ranging from unguided to feedback approaches using emoji-based indicators. The results reveal dramatic differences, but suggest there is still much work to be done to make passwords safe.},

We found that testing high on the awareness sub-scale correlated with correctly identifying a phishing website; testing high on the passwords sub-scale correlated with creating passwords that could not be quickly cracked; testing high on the updating sub-scale correlated with applying software updates; and testing high on the se- curement sub-scale correlated with smartphone lock screen usage (e.g., PINs). Our results indicate that SeBIS predicts certain computer security behaviors and that it is a reliable and valid tool that should be used in future research.},

abstract = {Investigations of computer user behavior become especially important when behaviors like security software adoption affect organizational information resource security, but adoption antecedents remain elusive. Technology adoption studies typically predict behavioral outcomes by investigating the relationship between attitudes and intentions, though intention may not be the best predictor of actual behavior. Personality constructs have recently been found to explain even more variance in behavior, thus providing insights into user behavior. This research incorporates conscientiousness and agreeableness into a conceptual model of security software use. Attitudinal constructs perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness were linked with behavioral intent, while the relationship between intent and actual use was found to be moderated by conscientiousness and agreeableness. The results that the moderating effect of personality greatly increases the amount of variance explained in actual use.},

@inproceedings{White2014IsntThatFabulous,
abstract = {Over the past few decades, passwords as a means of user authentication have been consistently criticized by users and security analysts alike. However, password-based systems are ubiquitous and entrenched in modern society-users understand how to use them, system administrators are intimately familiar with their operation, and many robust frameworks exist to make deploying passwords simple. Unfortunately, much of the formal research on user authentication has focused on attempting to provide alternatives (e.g., biometrics) to password-based mechanisms (or belated analyses of users' password choices), forcing administrators to use ad-hoc methods in attempts to improve security. This practice has lead to user frustration and inflated estimates of system security. We challenge common wisdom and re-examine whether pronounceable authentication strings might indeed offer a more reasonable alternative to traditional passwords. We argue that pronounceable authentication strings can lead to both improved system security and a decreased burden on users. To re-examine this potential, we explore questions related to how one might develop techniques for rating the pronounceability of word-like strings, and in doing so, enable one to quantify pronunciation difficulty. Armed with such an understanding, we posit new directions for generating usable passwords which are pronounceable and, we hope, memorable, hint-able and resistant to attack.},

A theory of dynamic choice reconstruction is presented to account for this effect. The theory is based on ideas of dominance seeking, in which the decision maker actively looks for ways to simplify the task. Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

We performed a laboratory experiment to examine whether these meters influenced users' password selections when they were forced to change their real passwords, and when they were not told that their passwords were the subject of a study. We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

For example, how much stronger are password choices for different categories of sites? We use a dataset which we extracted from a large dump of malware records. It contains multiple accounts (and passwords) per user and thus allows us to study both password re-use and the correlation between the value of an account and the strength of the passwords for those accounts. The first contribution of our study shows that users in our sample choose (substantially) stronger passwords for financial accounts than for low- value accounts, based on the extracted passwords as well as publicly available lists. This contribution has implications for password research, as some widely-used lists contain passwords much weaker than those used in the real world (for accounts of more than low value). In our second contribution, we measure password re-use taking account values into account. We see that although high-value passwords are stronger, they are re-used more frequently than low-value passwords – valuable passwords are identical to 21{\%} of the remaining passwords of a user. Before our study, little was known about password re-use for different account values.},

abstract = {Many secure systems rely on a “human in the loop” to perform security-critical functions. However, humans often fail in their security roles. Whenever possible, secure system designers should find ways of keeping humans out of the loop. However, there are some tasks for which feasible or cost effective alternatives to humans are not available. In these cases secure system designers should engineer their systems to support the humans in the loop and maxi- mize their chances of performing their security-critical functions successfully. We propose a framework for reason- ing about the human in the loop that provides a systematic approach to identifying potential causes for human fail- ure. This framework can be used by system designers to identify problem areas before a system is built and proac- tively address deficiencies. System operators can also use this framework to analyze the root cause of security failures that have been attributed to “human error.” We provide examples to illustrate the applicability of this framework to a variety of secure systems design problems, including anti-phishing warnings and password policies.},

To get a better under- standing, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=14) with drawing tasks about password managers and pass- word coping strategies in general. Our qualitative analyses through affinity diagrams reveal that users' individual coping strategies are a key need that may not be fully addressed by current solutions.

As an interesting practice of ubiquitous computing, emojis are adopted by Internet users from many different countries, on many devices (particularly popular on smartphones), and in many applications. The "ubiquitous" usage of emojis enables us to study and compare user behaviors and preferences across countries and cultures. We present an analysis on how smartphone users use emojis based on a very large data set collected from a popular emoji keyboard. The data set contains a complete month of emoji usage of 3.88 million active users from 212 countries and regions. We demonstrate that the categories and frequencies of emojis used by these users provide rich signals for the identification and the understanding of cultural differences of smartphone users. Users from different countries present significantly different preferences on emojis, which complies with the well-known Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.},

These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements.},

abstract = {A survey evaluating the generation and use of passwords revealed that students have 8.18 password uses. With 4.45 different passwords to cover these functions, the average password has 1.84 applications. Two thirds of passwords are designed around one's personal characteristics, with most of the remainder relating to relatives, friends or lovers. Proper names and birthdays are the primary information used in constructing passwords, accounting for about half of all password constructions. Almost all respondents reuse passwords, and about two thirds of password uses are duplications. Passwords have been forgotten by a third of respondents, and over half keep a written record of them. We found empirical confirmation of some ‘bad password practices' discussed in the literature, and provide suggestions for password construction and use.},

Users may take immediate action or ignore them depending on the importance of a notification as well as their current context. The nature of notifications is manifold, applications use them both sparsely and frequently. In this paper we present the first large-scale analysis of mobile notifications with a focus on users' subjective perceptions. We derive a holistic picture of notifications on mobile phones by collecting close to 200 million notifications from more than 40,000 users. Using a data-driven approach, we break down what users like and dislike about notifications. Our results reveal differences in importance of notifications and how users value notifications from messaging apps as well as notifications that include information about people and events. Based on these results we derive a number of findings about the nature of notifications and guidelines to effectively use them.},

Self-awareness induced by the presence of a mirror placed behind the candy bowl decreased transgression rates for children who had been individuated by asking them their name and address, but did not affect the behavior of children left anonymous. Self-awareness influenced older but not younger children. Naturally occurring standards instituted by the behavior of the first child to approach the candy bowl in each group were shown to interact with the experimenter's verbally stated standard. The behavior of 349 subjects in the second study replicated the findings in the first study. Additionally, when no standard was stated by the experimenter, children took more candy when not self-aware than when self-aware.},

As one response, basic SSL server certificates are being demoted to second-class status in conjunction with the introduction of Extended Validation (EV) SSL certifi- cates. Unfortunately, EV SSL certificates may complicate the already difficult design challenge of effectively convey- ing certificate information to the average user. This study explores the interfaces related to SSL certificates in the most widely deployed browser (Internet Explorer 7), proposes an alternative set of interface dialogs, and compares their effec- tiveness through a user study involving 40 participants. The alternative interface was found to offer statistically signifi- cant improvements in confidence, ease of finding informa- tion, and ease of understanding. Such results from a modest re-design effort suggest considerable room for improvement in the user interfaces of browsers today. This work moti- vates further study of whether EV SSL certificates offer a robust foundation for improving Internet trust, or a further compromise to usable security for ordinary users.},

This non-invasive technique for collecting spatio-temporal data about participant mobility and social interactions uses the capabilities of Bluetooth capable smartphones carried by participants. As a proof-of-concept we present a field study with deployment of the method in a large music festival with 130000 participants where a small subset of participants installed Bluetooth sensing apps on their personal smartphones. Our software module uses location and Bluetooth scans to utilize smartphones as provisional scanners that are present with higher frequency in regions with high density of participants. We discuss the initial results obtained and outline opportunities and challenges introduced by this methodology along with opportunities for future pervasive systems and applications.},

Science is a collective and cumulative enterprise, so to be qualified as usable, statistical tools should support and promote clear thinking as well as clear and truthful communication. Yet areas such as human-computer interaction (HCI) have adopted tools – i.e., p-values and statistical significance testing – that have proven to be quite poor at supporting these tasks. The use and misuse of p-values and significance testing has been severely criticized in a range of disciplines for several decades, suggesting that tools should be blamed, not end users. This article explains why it would be beneficial for HCI to switch from statis- tical significance testing to estimation, i.e., reporting informative charts with effect sizes and confidence intervals, and offering nuanced interpretations of our results. Advice is offered on how to communicate our empirical results in a clear, accurate, and transparent way without using any p-value. Key-words:},

We tested the availability of a large corpus of over 100,000 possible phrases at Amazons registration page, which prohibits using any phrase already registered by another user. A number of large, readily-available lists such as movie and book titles prove effective in guessing attacks, suggesting that passphrases are vulnerable to dictionary attacks like all schemes involving human choice. Extending our analysis with natural language phrases extracted from linguistic corpora, we find that phrase selection is far from random, with users strongly preferring simple noun bigrams which are common in natural language. The distribution of cho- sen passphrases is less skewed than the distribution of bigrams in English text, indicating that some users have attempted to choose phrases ran- domly. Still, the distribution of bigrams in natural language is not nearly random enough to resist offline guessing, nor are longer three- or four- word phrases for which we see rapidly diminishing returns.},

Specifically, several researchers have shown how different online privacy decisions are correlated with the " Big Five " personality traits. However, in our own research, we show that the five factor model is actually a weak predictor of privacy preferences and behaviors, and that other well-studied individual differences in the psychol-ogy literature are much stronger predictors. We describe the results of several experiments that showed how decision-making style and risk-taking attitudes are strong predictors of privacy attitudes, as well as a new scale that we devel-oped to measure security behavior intentions. Finally, we show that privacy and security attitudes are correlated, but orthogonal.},

@article{Iyengar2000WhenChoiceIsDemotivating,
abstract = {Current psychological theory and research affirm the positive affective and motivational consequences of having personal choice. These findings have led to the popular notion that the more choice, the better-that the human ability to manage, and the human desire for, choice is unlimited. Findings from 3 experimental studies starkly challenge this implicit assumption that having more choices is necessarily more intrinsically motivating than having fewer. These experiments, which were conducted in both field and laboratory settings, show that people are more likely to purchase gourmet jams or chocolates or to undertake optional class essay assignments when offered a limited array of 6 choices rather than a more extensive array of 24 or 30 choices. Moreover, participants actually reported greater subsequent satisfaction with their selections and wrote better essays when their original set of options had been limited. Implications for future research are discussed.},

@inproceedings{Wiedenbeck2006ConvexHull,
abstract = {When users input their passwords in a public place, they may be at risk of attackers stealing their password. An attacker can capture a password by direct observation or by recording the individual's authentication session. This is referred to as shoulder-surfing and is a known risk, of special concern when authenticating in public places. Until recently, the only defense against shoulder-surfing has been vigilance on the part of the user. This paper reports on the design and evaluation of a game-like graphical method of authentication that is resistant to shoulder-surfing. The Convex Hull Click (CHC) scheme allows a user to prove knowledge of the graphical password safely in an insecure location because users never have to click directly on their password images. Usability testing of the CHC scheme showed that novice users were able to enter their graphical password accurately and to remember it over time. However, the protection against shoulder-surfing comes at the price of longer time to carry out the authentication.},

abstract = {Judging others' personalities is an essential skill in successful social living, as personality is a key driver behind people's interactions, behaviors, and emotions. Although accurate personality judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher interjudge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.},

abstract = {We conduct a security analysis of five popular web-based password managers. Unlike “local” password managers, web-based password managers run in the browser. We identify four key security concerns for web-based pass- word managers and, for each, identify representative vul- nerabilities through our case studies. Our attacks are se- vere: in four out of the five password managers we stud- ied, an attacker can learn a user's credentials for arbi- trary websites. We find vulnerabilities in diverse features like one-time passwords, bookmarklets, and shared pass- words. The root-causes of the vulnerabilities are also di- verse: ranging from logic and authorization mistakes to misunderstandings about the web security model, in ad- dition to the typical vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS. Our study suggests that it remains to be a challenge for the password managers to be secure. To guide future de- velopment of password managers, we provide guidance for password managers. Given the diversity of vulner- abilities we identified, we advocate a defense-in-depth approach to ensure security of password managers},

@article{Rouzikhah2013,
abstract = {This paper examines the effects of an eco-driving message on driver distraction. Two in-vehicle distracter tasks were compared with an eco-driving task and a baseline task in an advanced driving simulator. N=22 subjects were asked to perform an eco-driving, CD changing, and a navigation task while engaged in critical manoeuvres during which they were expected to respond to a peripheral detection task (PDT) with total duration of 3.5h. The study involved two sessions over two consecutive days. The results show that drivers' mental workloads are significantly higher during navigation and CD changing tasks in comparison to the two other scenarios. However, eco-driving mental workload is still marginally significant (p∼.05) across different manoeuvres. Similarly, event detection tasks show that drivers miss significantly more events in the navigation and CD changing scenarios in comparison to both the baseline and eco-driving scenario. Analysis of the practice effect shows that drivers' baseline scenario and navigation scenario exhibit significantly less demand on the second day. Drivers also can detect significantly more events on the second day for all scenarios. The authors conclude that even reading a simple message while driving could potentially lead to missing an important event, especially when executing critical manoeuvres. However, there is some evidence of a practice effect which suggests that future research should focus on performance with habitual rather than novel tasks. It is recommended that sending text as an eco-driving message analogous to the study circumstances should not be delivered to drivers on-line when vehicle is in motion.},

We designed a new SSL warning based on recommendations from warning literature and tested our proposal with microsurveys and a field experiment. We ultimately failed at our goal of a well-understood warning. However, nearly 30{\%} more total users chose to remain safe after seeing our warning. We attribute this success to opinionated design, which promotes safety with visual cues. Subsequently, our proposal was released as the new Google Chrome SSL warning. We raise questions about warning comprehension advice and recommend that other warning designers use opinionated design.},

It follows that the contributions made in HCI tend to be familiar to engineering, design, or the social sciences. The seven research contribution types covered here are (1) empirical, (2) artifact, (3) methodological, (4) theoretical, (5) benchmark / dataset, (6) survey, and (7) opinion. Certainly, many research articles make more than one type of contribution.

abstract = {Over the recent years, the notion of a non-instrumental, hedonic quality of interactive products received growing interest. Based on a review of 151 publications, we summarize more than ten years research on the hedonic to provide an overview of definitions, assessment tools, antecedents, consequences, and correlates. We highlight a number of contributions, such as introducing experiential value to the practice of technology design and a better prediction of overall quality judgments and product acceptance. In addition, we suggest a number of areas for future research, such as providing richer, more nuanced models and tools for quantitative and qualitative analysis, more research on the consequences of using hedonic products and a better understanding of when the hedonic plays a role and when not.},

We present a study that examines how changing noise and dis-turbance in the environment affects user performance in a touchscreen typing task with the interface being presented through visual only, visual and tactile, or visual and audio feedback. The aim of the study is to show at what exact environmental levels audio or tactile feedback become inef-fective. The results show significant decreases in perform-ance for audio feedback at levels of 94dB and above as well as decreases in performance for tactile feedback at vibration levels of 9.18g/s. These results suggest that at these levels, feedback should be presented by a different modality. These findings will allow designers to take advantage of sensor enabled mobile devices to adapt the provided feed-back to the user's current context.},

The gap between the human and the computer creates potential for security problems. We examine this gap, as it is manifested in secure Web servers. Felten et al. demonstrated the potential, in 1996, for malicious servers to impersonate honest servers. In this paper, we show how malicious servers can still do this—and can also forge the existence of an SSL session and the contents of the alleged server certificate.We then consider how to systematically defend against Web spoofing, by creating a trusted path from the browser to the human user. We present potential designs, propose a new one, prototype it in open-source Mozilla, and demonstrate its effectiveness via user studies.},

abstract = {Mobile data traffic is expected to grow exponentially in the next few years due to the explosive growth of mobile web and video traffic on smartphones. Wireless operators have invested heavily to make infrastructural improvements by installing new cell towers and offloading cellular data traffic to Wi-Fi to resolve congestion. They are also exploring the use of behavioral and economic interventions to manage congestion. To understand the role of interventions, we distributed smartphones to students at Purdue University, loaded with applications to perform monitoring and location tracking with user consent. We conducted two experiments: first with 14 phones of one type, then with 30 phones of two types. Wi-Fi traffic and cellular network data usage were collected and analyzed to characterize and quantify the changes in usage behaviors; the second experiment also captured location data during compliance/non-compliance to incentive messages. The trial seeks not only to experiment with incentives and disincentives to observe their effectiveness, but also to understand current mobile broadband and Wi-Fi usage behaviors in a campus environment. Our results indicate a high level of compliance with economic incentives and disincentives. Detailed analysis further showed correlation with two psychological measures of each user (agreeableness and neuroticism). In addition, we found schemes with probabilistic payments of higher incentive amounts getting more positive results compared to schemes with definite payments with lower incentive amounts, despite similar total payout.},

abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

It is common for values greater than 0.9 to be considered an indication of acceptable model fit. This Monte Carlo study examined the performance of the GFI under conditions of varying sample size, model specification and magnitude of factor loadings. It was found that these three factors influenced GFI independently, and jointly in terms of interactions. It was concluded that a cut-off value of 0.9 would result in an unacceptable number of misspecified models being accepted.},

First, we propose a Parametric Rectified Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU improves model fitting with nearly zero extra com-putational cost and little overfitting risk. Second, we de-rive a robust initialization method that particularly consid-ers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet 2012 classifica-tion dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%} [29]).

abstract = {Millions of users are exposed to password-strength meters/checkers at highly popular web services that use user- chosen passwords for authentication. Recent studies have found evidence that some meters actually guide users to choose better passwords—which is a rare bit of good news in password research. However, these meters are mostly based on ad-hoc design. At least, as we found, most vendors do not provide any explanation of their design choices, sometimes making them appear to be a black box. We analyze password meters deployed in selected popular websites, by measuring the strength labels assigned to common passwords from several password dictio- naries. From this empirical analysis with millions of passwords, we report prominent characteristics of meters as deployed at popular websites. We shed light on how the server-end of some meters functions, provide examples of highly inconsistent strength outcomes for the same password in different meters, along with examples of many weak passwords being labeled as strong or even very strong. These weaknesses and inconsistencies may confuse users in choosing a stronger password, and thus may weaken the purpose of these meters. On the other hand, we believe these findings may help improve existing meters, and possibly make them an effective tool in the long run. I.},

abstract = {Notes that self-awareness theory has generated a considerable amount of research activity; however, the most widely used manipulation of self-focus—the mirror—has not been satisfactorily validated. Exp I was an attempt to do so. At the same time an attempt was made to validate the Self-Consciousness Scale (SCS), an instrument designed to measure chronic dispositions to be self-attentive. 79 female undergraduates responded to a sentence completion blank either in an empty room or while facing a mirror. Results indicate that the mirror does manipulate, and the private subscale of the SCS does measure, self-attention. Exp II, with 81 female undergraduates, was a replication of the 1st study, but using an audience instead of a mirror. Results indicate that audience presence also heightens self-attention. Implications for attentional analyses of social behavior are discussed.},

abstract = {Passwords remain the dominant authentication mechanism for information security. Unfortunately, research has shown that most passwords are highly insecure. Given the risks of using weak passwords, there is a need to effectively motivate users to select strong passwords. In this study we examine the influence of interactivity, as well as static and interactive fear appeals, on motivating users to increase the strength of their passwords. We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries. We found that while the interactive password strength meter and static fear appeal treatments were not effective, the interactive fear appeal treatment resulted in significantly stronger passwords. Our findings suggest that interactive fear appeals are a promising means of encouraging a range of secure behaviors in end users.},

abstract = {This paper lays out the relevance of the investigation of the underlying social dynamics and temporalities of energy demand for energy and social science research. Elements of a distinctive approach to researching the dynamics of energy demand are outlined, starting from the observation that demand is an outcome of what energy is for. Energy demand, it is argued, is a product of the vast array of interwoven social practices out of which the ordering of society is made. It is therefore necessary to understand how temporal patterns are already embedded in the social world in order to follow how energy use changes and varies over time. Three forms or categories of dynamic are discussed - change, rhythm and synchronicity - each providing a different way of approaching the relation between time, social practice and energy demand. In the course of discussion the increasing relevance of temporal patterning to both supply and demand-side policy and practice is made clear. In concluding further scope for a broadening of time-focused energy demand research is identified. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {How people intentionally change addictive behaviors with and without treatment is not well understood by behavioral scientists. This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

Bringing multi-touch into desktop computing would give users an additional input channel to leverage, enriching the current interaction paradigm dominated by a mouse and keyboard. We provide two main contributions in this domain. First, we describe the results from a study we performed, which systematically evaluates the various potential regions within the traditional desktop configuration that could become multi-touch enabled. The study sheds light on good or bad regions for multi-touch, and also the type of input most appropriate for each of these regions. Second, guided by the results from our study, we explore the design space of multi-touch-integrated desktop experiences. A set of new interaction techniques are coherently integrated into a desktop prototype, called Magic Desk, demonstrating potential uses for multi-touch enabled desktop configurations.},

This paper examines the vulnerability of UNIX to attacks on its password system. Over the past 10 years, improvements in hardware and software have increased the crypts/second/dollar ratio by orders of magnitude. We reexamine the UNIX password system in light of these advances and point out possible solutions to the problem of easily found passwords. The paper discusses how the authors built some high-speed tools for password cracking and what elements were necessary for their success. These elements are examined to determine if any of them can be removed from the hands of a possible system innltrator, and thus increase the security of the system. We conclude that the single most important step that can be taken to improve password security is to increase password entropy.},

Drawing on memory research and the importance of meaning, the efficacy of three alternative “password” systems having varying degrees of personal meaning were compared with the more traditional but personally meaningless randomly generated alphanumeric passwords. Twenty experienced computer users self-generated four-string variable passwords based on alphanumerics, symbols of personal meaning and faces. Additionally, participants were assigned a meaningless, randomly generated four-character alphanumeric password. Password memorability was measured in terms of acquisition (number of trials/time to criterion), retention (fromforgetting functions) and retrieval (time to recall/recognize the passwords). Meaning was found to assist memora- bility and a mediating effect of familiarity was also observed. Contrary to expectation, self-generated, meaningful symbol-based passwords were not the best remembered of the password types studied but may still be a viable overall alternative.},

This paper provides the first empirical evidence about which malicious strategies are successful at deceiving general users. We first analyzed a large set of captured phishing attacks and developed a set of hypotheses about why these strategies might work. We then assessed these hypotheses with a usability study in which 22 participants were shown 20 web sites and asked to determine which ones were fraudulent. We found that 23{\%} of the participants did not look at browser-based cues such as the address bar, status bar and the security indicators, leading to incorrect choices 40{\%} of the time. We also found that some visual deception attacks can fool even the most sophisticated users. These results illustrate that standard security indicators are not effective for a substantial fraction of users, and suggest that alternative approaches are needed.},

abstract = {Phishers are fraudsters that mimic legitimate websites to steal user's credential information and exploit that information for identity theft and other criminal activities. Various anti-phishing techniques attempt to mitigate such attacks. Domain highlighting is one such approach recently incorporated by several popular web browsers. The idea is simple: the domain name of an address is highlighted in the address bar, so that users can inspect it to determine a web site's legitimacy. Our research asks a basic question: how well does domain highlighting work? To answer this, we showed 22 participants 16 web pages typical of those targeted for phishing attacks, where participants had to determine the page's legitimacy. In the first round, they judged the page's legitimacy by whatever means they chose. In the second round, they were directed specifically to look at the address bar. We found that participants fell into 3 types in terms of how they determined the legitimacy of a web page; while domain highlighting was somewhat effective for one user type, it was much less effective for others. We conclude that domain highlighting, while providing some benefit, cannot be relied upon as the sole method to prevent phishing attacks.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new class of Human Interactive Proofs (HIPs) that allow a human to distinguish one computer from another. Unlike traditional HIPs, where the computer issues a challenge to the user over a network, in this case, the user issues a challenge to the computer. This type of HIP can be used to detect phishing attacks, in which websites are spoofed in order to trick users into revealing private information. We define five properties of an ideal HIP to detect phishing attacks. Using these properties, we evaluate existing and proposed anti-phishing schemes to discover their benefits and weaknesses. We review a new anti-phishing proposal, Dynamic Security Skins (DSS), and show that it meets the HIP criteria. Our goal is to allow a remote server to prove its identity in a way that is easy for a human user to verify and hard for an attacker to spoof. In our scheme, the web server presents its proof in the form of an image that is unique for each user and each transaction. To authenticate the server, the user can visually verify that the image presented by the server matches a reference image presented by the browser.},

First, the study contributes to our understanding of the role of pragmatic philosophy, which is now dominating HCI both as a guide for design and as a guide when looking at social practices, in outlining the role of aesthetics in experience design. Fashion practices di- verge from this theory, since here aesthetic appearances can be visual, ambiguous and incomplete although it still pro- vides a lot of meanings for people. We argue that our find- ings should influence the discussion in HCI to consider a less theoretically oriented aesthetic approach, where instead empirical studies get at the forefront. Second, the study provides valuable insight on how we should design mobile experiences to attract more attention from people interested in fashion. Mobile phones, and their services, can for ex- ample be designed to relate to the visual appearance of the dressed outfit, or ensemble of a person.},

@article{Stanovich2000,
abstract = {Much research in the last two decades has demonstrated that human responses deviate from the performance deemed normative according to various models of decision making and rational judgment (e.g., the basic axioms of utility theory). This gap between the normative and the descriptive can be interpreted as indicating systematic irrationalities in human cognition. However, four alternative interpretations preserve the assumption that human behavior and cognition is largely rational. These posit that the gap is due to (1) performance errors, (2) computational limitations, (3) the wrong norm being applied by the experimenter, and (4) a different construal of the task by the subject. In the debates about the viability of these alternative explanations, attention has been focused too narrowly on the model response. In a series of experiments involving most of the classic tasks in the heuristics and biases literature, we have examined the implications of individual differences in performance for each of the four explanations of the normative/descriptive gap. Performance errors are a minor factor in the gap; computational limitations underlie non-normative responding on several tasks, particularly those that involve some type of cognitive decontextualization. Unexpected patterns of covariance can suggest when the wrong norm is being applied to a task or when an alternative construal of the task should be considered appropriate.},

abstract = {In this study, we propose a hierarchy of password importance, and we use an experiment to examine the degree of similarity between passwords for lower-level (e.g. news portal) and higher-level (e.g. banking) websites in this hierarchy. We asked subjects to construct passwords for websites at both levels. Leveraging the lower-level passwords along with a dictionary attack, we successfully cracked almost one-third of the subjects' higher-level passwords. In a survey, subjects reported frequently reusing higher-level passwords, with or without modifications, as well as using a similar process to construct both levels of passwords. We thus conclude that unsafely shared or leaked lower-level passwords can be used by attackers to crack higher-level passwords. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

As part of a trading card context, users get rewarded with gadgets and points for documenting the existence of NFC technology in their environment. This paper describes the development of this game and the experiences of two release cycles. The paper concludes with lessons learned and provides an outlook on next steps.

@article{Fagan2017UsersConsiderationsPWMs,
abstract = {Password managers, though commonly recommended by security experts, are still not used by many users. Understanding why some choose to use password managers while others do not is important towards generally understanding why some users do what they do and, by extension, designing motivational tools such as video tutorials to help motivate more to use password managers. To investigate differences between those who do and do not use a password manager, for this paper, we distributed an online survey to a total of 137 users and 111 non-users of the tool that asked about their opinions/experiences with password managers. Furthermore, since emotion has been identified by work in psychology and communications as influential in other risk- laden decision-making (e.g., safe-sex behavior such as condom use), we asked partici- pants who use a password manager to rate how they feel for 45 different emotions, or, as the case for those who do not use a password manager, to rate how they imagine they would feel the 45 emotions if they did use the tool. Our results show that “users” of password managers noted convenience and usefulness as the main reasons behind using the tool, rather than security gains, underscoring the fact that even a large por- tion of users of the tool are not considering security as the primary benefit while mak- ing the decision. On the other hand, “non-users” noted security concerns as the main reason for not using a password manager, highlighting the prevalence of suspicion arising from lack of understanding of the technology itself. Finally, analysis of the differ- ences in emotions between “users” and “non-users” reveals that participants who never use a password manager are more likely to feel suspicious compared to “users,” which could be due to misunderstandings about the tool.},

abstract = {This paper explores a judgmental heuristic in which a person evaluates the frequency of classes or the probability of events by availability, i.e., by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind. In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

We used Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome's in-browser telemetry to observe over 25 million warning impressions in situ. During our field study, users continued through a tenth of Mozilla Fire- fox's malware and phishing warnings, a quarter of Google Chrome's malware and phishing warnings, and a third of Mozilla Firefox's SSL warnings. This demonstrates that security warnings can be effective in practice; security experts and system architects should not dismiss the goal of communicating security information to end users. We also find that user behavior varies acrosswarnings. In con- trast to the other warnings, users continued through 70.2{\%} of Google Chrome's SSL warnings. This indicates that the user experience of a warning can have a significant impact on user behavior. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for warning designers and researchers.},

Sadly, they often result in users' passwords exhibiting new, yet still predictable, patterns. In this paper, we investigate the usability and security of adaptive password-composition policies, which dynamically change password requirements over time as users create new passwords. We conduct a 2,619- participant between-subjects online experiment to evaluate the strength and usability of passwords created with two adaptive password policies. We also design and test a feedback system that guides users to successfully create a password conforming to these policies. We find that a wellconfigured, structure-based adaptive password policy can significantly increase password strength with little to no decrease in usability. We discuss how system administrators can use these results to improve password diversity.},

As a step towards solving this problem, we have been examining how people experience security as a facet of their daily life, and how they routinely answer the question, "is this system secure enough for what I want to do?" We present a number of findings concerning the scope of security, attitudes towards security, and the social and organizational contexts within which security concerns arise, and point towards emerging technical solutions.},

@article{Shropshire2006PersonalityITSec,
abstract = {Despite numerous advances in IT security, many computer users are still vulnerable to security-related risks because they do not comply with organizational policies and procedures. In a network setting, individual risk can extend to all networked users. Endpoint security refers to the set of organizational policies, procedures, and practices directed at securing the endpoint of the network connections – the individual end user. As such, the challenges facing IT managers in providing effective endpoint security are unique in that they often rely heavily on end user participation. But vulnerability can be minimized through modification of desktop security programs and increased vigilance on the part of the system administrator or CSO. The cost-prohibitive nature of these measures generally dictates targeting high-risk users on an individual basis. It is therefore important to differentiate between individuals who are most likely to pose a security risk and those who will likely follow most organizational policies and procedures. Keywords},

Results indicate that, in general, users do not vary the complexity of passwords depending on the nature of the site (bank account vs. instant messenger) or change their passwords on any regular basis if it is not required by the site. Users report using lower case letters, numbers or digits, personally meaningful numbers and personally meaningful words when creating passwords, despite the fact that they realize that these methods may not be the most secure.},

We design OTO, a system for communicating these trust evidence indicators to users, and we demonstrate through a user study the effectiveness of OTO, even with respect to IE's SmartScreen Filter (SSF). The results from the between-subjects experiment with 58 participants confirm that the OTO interface helps people make correct trust decisions compared to the SSF interface regardless of their security knowledge, education level, occupation, age, or gender.},

This paper examines how di↵erent kinds of memory retrieval a↵ect the memorability and usability of random assigned graphical passwords. A series of five studies of graphical and text passwords showed that participants were able to better remember recognition-based graphical passwords, but their usability was limited by slow login times. A graphical password scheme that leveraged recognition and recall memory was most successful at combining memorability and usability.},

It allows using tools to enliven processes that have been defined. Transition methods are most likely the most important player in the engineering of software. The 4SRS (Four Step Rule Set) is a transition method we adopt in this paper to focus the discussion on the transition from the analysis to the design of software. It has been formalized as a small software development process that can be plugged into larger software development processes. That formalization was conducted with the SPEM (Software {\&} Systems Process Engineering Metamodel), which is a process modeling language for the domain of software and systems. This paper exemplifies how a transition method like the 4SRS can be modeled with the SPEM as a way to study the benefits of the automatic or semiautomatic execution of a transition method as a small dedicated software development process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

@article{Riegelsberger2003,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Designing for trust in technology-mediated interaction is an increasing concern in CHI. In advertising, images of people have long been used to create positive attitudes to products or trust in brands. However, the evidence as to whether placing photographs of people on e-commerce web sites has the intended effect has been mixed. This paper reports a study that examined the effect of adding such photographs to 12 existing e-commerce sites, whose reputation had been established through customer ratings. In an experiment with 115 participants, trust was measured using methods that induced financial risk, adapted from experimental economics. Averaging across sites, neither the presence of a photo, nor trustworthiness of the person depicted, had a significant effect. However, the presence of photos reduced participants' ability to identify vendors with good and bad reputations – the perceived trustworthiness of poorly performing vendors was increased, whereas that of vendors with good reputation was decreased. This result advocates caution when using photos on e-commerce sites to boost trustworthiness, and demonstrates the need for further research into interpersonal cues and on-line trust.},

abstract = {Given the widespread use of password authentication in on- line correspondence, subscription services, and shopping, there is growing concern about identity theft. When peo- ple reuse their passwords across multiple accounts, they in- crease their vulnerability; compromising one password can help an attacker take over several accounts. Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

@inproceedings{Whitten1999WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt,
abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

Analysis of the questionnaires shows that many users report problems, linked to the number of passwords and frequency of password use. In-depth analysis of the interview data revealed that the degree to which users conform to security mechanisms depends on their perception of security levels, information sensitivity and compatibility with work practices. Security mechanisms incompatible with these perceptions may be circumvented by users and thereby undermine system security overall.},

When analyzing the most common attacks and the reasons for successful frauds, it becomes apparent that the main problem lies in the PIN based authentication which in itself does not provide any security features (besides the use of asterisks). That is, security is solely based on a user's behavior. Indirect input is one way to solve this problem. This mostly comes at the costs of adding overhead to the input process. We present ColorPIN, an authentication mechanism that uses indirect input to provide security enhanced PIN entry. At the same time, ColorPIN remains a one-to-one relationship between the length of the PIN and the required number of clicks. A user study showed that ColorPIN is significantly more secure than standard PIN entry while enabling good authentication speed in comparison with related systems.},

abstract = {Security experts frequently refer to people as “the weakest link in the chain” of system security. Famed hacker Kevin Mitnick revealed that he hardly ever cracked a password, because it “was easier to dupe people into revealing it” by employing a range of social engineering techniques. Often, such failures are attributed to users' carelessness and ignorance. However, more enlightened researchers have pointed out that current security tools are simply too complex for many users, and they have made efforts to improve user interfaces to security tools. In this chapter, we aim to broaden the current perspective, focusing on the usability of security tools (or products) and the process of designing secure systems for the real-world context (the panorama) in which they have to operate. Here we demonstrate how current human factors knowledge and user-centered design principles can help security designers produce security solutions that are effective in practice.},

@inproceedings{Egelman2010PleaseContinueToHold,
abstract = {We present the results of an experiment examining the extent to which individuals will tolerate delays when told that such delays are for security purposes. In our experiment, we asked 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk users to count the total number of times a certain term was repeated in a multi-page document. The task was designed to be conducive to cheating. We assigned subjects to four between-subjects conditions: one of these offered a concrete security reason (virus-scanning) for the delay, another offered only a vague security explanation, another did not mention security at all, and a control condition without a delay. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to cheat or abandon the task when provided no explanation or a vague security explanation for the delay. However, when subjects were provided more explanation about the threat model and the protection ensured by the delay, they were not more likely to cheat than subjects in the control condition who faced no such delay. Our results thus contribute to the nascent literature on soft paternalistic solutions to security and privacy problems by suggesting that, when security mitigations cannot be made “free” for users, designers may incentivize compliant users' behavior by intentionally drawing attention to the mitigation itself.},

Strong passwords do nothing to protect online users from password stealing attacks such as phishing and keylogging, and yet they place considerable burden on users. Passwords that are too weak of course invite brute-force attacks. However, we find that relatively weak passwords, about 20 bits or so, are sufficient to make brute-force attacks on a single account unrealistic so long as a "three strikes" type rule is in place. Above that minimum it appears that increasing password strength does little to address any real threat. If a larger credential space is needed it appears better to increase the strength of the userID's rather than the passwords. For large institutions this is just as effective in deterring bulk guessing attacks and is a great deal better for users. For small institutions there appears little reason to require strong passwords for online accounts.},

This attack method, commonly known as “phishing,” is most commonly initiated by sending out emails with links to spoofed websites that harvest information. We present a method for detecting these attacks, which in its most gen- eral form is an application of machine learning on a fea- ture set designed to highlight user-targeted deception in electronic communication. This method is applicable, with slight modification, to detection of phishing websites, or the emails used to direct victims to these sites. We evaluate this method on a set of approximately 860 such phishing emails, and 6950 non-phishing emails, and correctly identify over 96{\%} of the phishing emails while only mis-classifying on the order of 0.1{\%} of the legitimate emails. We conclude with thoughts on the future for such techniques to specifi- cally identify deception, specifically with respect to the evo- lutionary nature of the attacks and information available.},

@inproceedings{Egelman2013ProfilePassword,
abstract = {We performed a laboratory experiment to study the pri- vacy tradeoff offered by Facebook Connect: disclosing Facebook profile data to third-party websites for the convenience of logging in without creating separate ac- counts. We controlled for trustworthiness and amount of information each website requested, as well as the con- sent dialog layout. We discovered that these factors had no observable effects, likely because participants did not read the dialogs. Yet, 15{\%} still refused to use Facebook Connect, citing privacy concerns. A likely explanation for subjects ignoring the dialogs while also understand- ing the privacy tradeoff—our exit survey indicated that 88{\%} broadly understood what data would be collected— is that subjects were already familiar with the dialogs prior to the experiment. We discuss how our results demonstrate informed consent, but also how habitua- tion prevented subjects from understanding the nuances between individual websites' data collection policies.},

Moreover, the effect of income on life satisfaction seems to be transient. We argue that people exaggerate the contribution of income to happiness because they focus, in part, on conventional achievements when evaluating their life or the lives of others.},

@article{Barbera2013,
abstract = {The ever increasing ubiquitousness of WiFi access points, coupled with the diffusion of smartphones, suggest that Internet every time and everywhere will soon (if not already has) become a reality. Even in presence of 3G connectivity, our devices are built to switch automatically to WiFi networks so to improve user experience. Most of the times, this is achieved by recurrently broadcasting automatic connectivity requests (known as Probe Requests) to known access points (APs), like, e.g., "Home WiFi", "Campus WiFi", and so on. In a large gathering of people, the number of these probes can be very high. This scenario rises a natural question: "Can significant information on the social structure of a large crowd and on its socioeconomic status be inferred by looking at smartphone probes?". In this work we give a positive answer to this question. We organized a 3-months long campaign, through which we collected around 11M probes sent by more than 160K different devices. During the campaign we targeted national and international events that attracted large crowds as well as other gatherings of people. Then, we present a simple and automatic methodology to build the underlying social graph of the smartphone users, starting from their probes. We do so for each of our target events, and find that they all feature social-network properties. In addition, we show that, by looking at the probes in an event, we can learn important sociological aspects of its participants---language, vendor adoption, and so on.},

@inproceedings{Krol2016ExperimentDesign,
abstract = {Background: Human beings are an integral part of com-puter security, whether we actively participate or simply build the systems. Despite this importance, understand-ing users and their interaction with security is a blind spot for most security practitioners and designers. Aim: Define principles for conducting experiments into usable security and privacy, to improve study robustness and usefulness. Data: The authors' experiences conducting several re-search projects complemented with a literature survey. Method: We extract principles based on relevance to the advancement of the state of the art. We then justify our choices by providing published experiments as cases of where the principles are and are not followed in practice to demonstrate the impact. Each principle is a discipline-specific instantiation of desirable experiment-design ele-ments as previously established in the domain of philos-ophy of science. Results: Five high-priority principles – (i) give par-ticipants a primary task; (ii) incorporate realistic risk; (iii) avoid priming the participants; (iv) perform double-blind experiments whenever possible and (v) think care-fully about how meaning is assigned to the terms threat model, security, privacy, and usability. Conclusion: The principles do not replace researcher acumen or experience, however they can provide a valu-able service for facilitating evaluation, guiding younger researchers and students, and marking a baseline com-mon language for discussing further improvements.},

Moreover, the lack of scientific evidence about the concrete impact of mobile phones' screen size on usability raises questions both to practitioners and researchers. In this paper, we investigate the impact of a mobile phone's screen size on users' effectiveness, efficiency and perceived usability as measured using System Usability Scale (SUS). An experiment was conducted with 60 participants, which interacted with the same information seeking application on three different devices of the same brand that differed on their screen size. A significant effect of screen size on efficiency was derived, leading to an important finding that users who interact with larger than 4.3in screens are more efficient during information seeking tasks.},

The experiment used a computerized application as a surrogate for an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). Perceptions were elicited before and after the participants used the system. Pre-experimental measures indicate strong correlations between system's perceived aesthetics and perceived usability. Post-experimental measures indicated that the strong correlation remained intact. A multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that the degree of system's aesthetics affected the post-use perceptions of both aesthetics and usability, whereas the degree of actual usability had no such effect. The results resemble those found by social psychologists regarding the effect of physical attractiveness on the valuation of other personality attributes. The findings stress the importance of studying the aesthetic aspect of human-computer interaction (HCI) design and its relationships to other design dimensions.},

Over the last 15 years a range of password generator systems have been described. This paper proposes the first general model for such systems, and critically examines options for instantiating this model; options considered include all those previously proposed as part of existing schemes as well as certain novel possibilities. The model enables a more objective and high-level assessment of the design of such systems; it has also been used to sketch a possible new scheme, AutoPass, intended to incorporate the best features of the prior art whilst also addressing many of the most serious shortcomings of existing systems through the inclusion of novel features.},

@article{Jenkins2014a,
abstract = {Password reuse-using the same password for multiple accounts-is a prevalent phenomenon that can make even the most secure systems vulnerable. When passwords are reused across multiple systems, hackers may compromise accounts by stealing passwords from low-security sites to access sites with higher security. Password reuse can be particularly threatening to users in developing countries in which cyber-security training is limited, law enforcement of cyber-security is non-existent, or in which programs to secure cyberspace are limited. This article proposes a two-pronged solution for reducing password reuse through detection and mitigation. First, based on the theories of routine, cognitive load, and motor movement, we hypothesize that password reuse can be detected by monitoring characteristics of users' typing behavior (i.e., keystroke dynamics). Second, based on protection motivation theory, we hypothesize that providing just-in-time fear appeals when a violation is detected will decrease password reuse. We tested our hypotheses in an experiment and found that users' keystroke dynamics are diagnostic of password reuse. By analyzing changes in typing patterns, we were able to detect password reuse with 81.71{\%} accuracy. We also found that just-in-time fear appeals decrease password reuse; 88.41{\%} of users who received a fear appeal subsequently created unique passwords, whereas only 4.45{\%} of users who did not receive a fear appeal created unique passwords. Our results suggest that future research should continue to examine keystroke dynamics as an indicator of cyber-security behaviors, and use just-in-time fear appeals as a method for reducing non-secure behavior. The findings of our research provide a practical and cost-effective solution to bolster cyber-security through discouraging password reuse.

The person who creates that environment is, in our terminology, a choice architect. In this paper we analyze some of the tools that are available to choice architects. Our goal is to show how choice architecture can be used to help nudge people to make better choices (as judged by themselves) without forcing certain outcomes upon anyone, a philosophy we call libertarian paternalism. The tools we highlight are: defaults, expecting error, understanding mappings, giving feedback, structuring complex choices, and creating incentives.},

Recent years have brought a rash of high-profile account compromises, but account hijacking is not limited to high-profile accounts. In this paper, we report results of a survey about people's experiences with and attitudes toward account hijacking. The problem is widespread; 30{\%} of our 294 participants had an email or social networking account accessed by an unauthorized party. Five themes emerged from our results: (1) compromised accounts are often valuable to victims, (2) attackers are mostly unknown, but sometimes known, to victims, (3) users acknowledge some responsibility for keeping their accounts secure, (4) users' understanding of important security measures is incomplete, and (5) harm from account hijacking is concrete and emotional. We discuss implications for designing security mechanisms to improve chances for user adoption.},

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.},

All common mobile platforms and many desktop systems now support emoji entry and users have embraced their use. Yet, we currently know very little about what makes for good emoji entry. While soft keyboards for text entry are well optimized, based on language and touch models, no such information exists to guide the design of emoji keyboards. In this article, we investigate of the problem of emoji entry, starting with a study of the current state of the emoji keyboard implementation in Android. To enable moving forward to novel emoji keyboard designs, we then explore a model for emoji similarity that is able to inform such designs. This semantic model is based on data from 21 million collected tweets containing emoji. We compare this model against a solely description-based model of emoji in a crowdsourced study. Our model shows good performance in capturing detailed relationships between emoji.},

Information campaigns emphasize that alco- hol and drug use is intolerably high, that adolescent suicide rates are alarming, and—most relevant to this article—that ram- pant polluters are spoiling the environment. Although these claims may be both true and well intentioned, the campaigns' cre- ators have missed something critically important: Within the statement “Many people are doing this undesirable thing” lurks the powerful and under- cutting normative message “Many people are doing this.” Only by aligning descriptive norms (what people typically do) with injunctive norms (what people typically approve or disapprove) can one optimize the power of normative ap- peals. Communicators who fail to recognize the distinction be- tween these two types of norms imperil their persuasive efforts. Keywords},

Contrary to the assumption underlying the fundamental attribution error, the imputation of dispositional characteristics to individuals may be both logically and empirically tenable. Cogent address of the accuracy of attribution necessitates much greater progress toward establishing criteria of accuracy than has occurred to date. At present, evidence regarding a pronounced tendency to make attributions to situational factors may just as likely represent a fundamental error as it does a strong tendency to make attributions to dispositional characteristics. Also discussed are a distinction between error and bias and some of the indirect evidence that has been represented as showing the fundamental attribution error.

@article{Arachchilage2013GameDesingPhishing,
abstract = {Game based education is becoming more and more popular. This is because game based education provides an opportunity for learning in a natural environment. Phishing is an online identity theft, which attempts to steal sensitive information such as username, password, and online banking details from its victims. To prevent this, phishing awareness needs to be considered. This research aims to develop a game design framework, which enhances user avoidance behaviour through motivation to protect users from phishing attacks. In order to do this, a theoretical model derived from Technology Thread Avoidance Theory (TTAT) was developed and used in the game design framework (Liang {\&} Xue, 2010). A survey study was undertaken with 150 regular computer users to elicit feedback through a questionnaire. The study findings revealed that perceived threat, safeguard effectiveness, safeguard cost, self-efficacy, perceived severity, and perceived susceptibility elements should be addressed in the game design framework for computer users to avoid phishing attacks. Furthermore, we argue that this game design framework can be used not only for preventing phishing attacks but also for preventing other malicious IT attacks such as viruses, malware, botnets and spyware.{\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Emoji are commonly used in modern text communication. However, as graphics with nuanced details, emoji may be open to interpretation. Emoji also render differently on different viewing platforms (e.g., Apple's iPhone vs. Google's Nexus phone), potentially leading to communication errors. We explore whether emoji renderings or differences across platforms give rise to diverse interpretations of emoji. Through an online survey, we solicit people's interpretations of a sample of the most popular emoji characters, each rendered for multiple platforms. Both in terms of sentiment and semantics, we analyze the variance in interpretation of the emoji, quantifying which emoji are most (and least) likely to be misinterpreted. In cases in which participants rated the same emoji rendering, they disagreed on whether the sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative 25{\%} of the time. When considering renderings across platforms, these disagreements only increase. Overall, we find significant potential for miscommunication, both for individual emoji renderings and for different emoji renderings across platforms.},

By leveraging the Project Oxford Emotion API from Microsoft's cognitive services platform, which provides automated detection of human emotion expressions on human faces, we generate a tagged dataset in an automated fashion. Through the use of image warping and distortion techniques, we can significantly increase the robustness of the CAPTCHA against automated attacks, without compromising on usability, as confirmed by our user study.},

Behavioral economics has produced theories to explain when and why people make such allegedly irrational decisions, for example if it comes to spending money. However, humans tend to use reference points to judge and decide. Nowadays, mobile devices can work as flexible tools to create reference points thus supporting decisions without being explicit about it. We discuss if and how mobile apps can influence decision making. As a consequence, apps can be built to better fit into the decision making progress.

@unpublished{Sasse2005UsabilityTrust,
abstract = {The need for people to protect themselves and their assets is as old as humankind. People's physical safety and their possessions have always been at risk from deliberate attack or accidental damage. The advance of information technology means that many individuals, as well as corporations, have an additional range of physical (equipment) and electronic (data) assets that are at risk. Furthermore, the increased number and types of interactions in cyberspace has enabled new forms of attack on people and their possessions. Consider grooming of minors in chat-rooms, or Nigerian email cons: minors were targeted by paedophiles before the creation of chat-rooms, and Nigerian criminals sent the same letters by physical mail or fax before there was email. But the technology has decreased the cost of many types of attacks, or the degree of risk for the attackers. At the same time, cyberspace is still new to many people, which means they do not understand risks, or recognise the signs of an attack, as readily as they might in the physical world. The IT industry has developed a plethora of security mechanisms, which could be used to mitigate risks or make attacks significantly more difficult. Currently, many people are either not aware of these mechanisms, or are unable or unwilling or to use them. Security experts have taken to portraying people as "the weakest link" in their efforts to deploy effective security [e.g. Schneier, 2000]. However, recent research has revealed at least some of the problem may be that security mechanisms are hard to use, or be ineffective. The review summarises current research on the usability of security mechanisms, and discusses options for increasing their usability and effectiveness.},

@inproceedings{Fahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy,
abstract = {The ecological validity of password studies is a complex topic and difficult to quantify. Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

Two groups of 50 subjects each were asked to generate a password. One group was cognitively depleted, the other was not. Password strength was measured and compared across groups. We find that subjects who are cognitively depleted create worse passwords than undepleted subjects. Surprisingly, subjects who report mild cognitive exertion create better password than undepleted subjects. We are interested in discussing how cognitive effort impacts authentication as well as how to negotiate the cognitive demands of password procedures to best support users.},

@article{Brustoloni2007,
abstract = {Context-sensitive guidance (CSG) can help users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask the user to provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security dialogs irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic dialogs continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. Audited dialogs thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic dialogs. Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited dialogs. In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional dialogs. Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks.},

There currently exist several publicly-available, pre-trained sets of word embeddings, but they contain few or no emoji representations even as emoji usage in social media has increased. In this paper we release emoji2vec, pre-trained embeddings for all Unicode emoji which are learned from their description in the Unicode emoji standard. The resulting emoji embeddings can be readily used in downstream social natural language processing applications alongside word2vec. We demonstrate, for the downstream task of sentiment analysis, that emoji embeddings learned from short descriptions outperforms a skip-gram model trained on a large collection of tweets, while avoiding the need for contexts in which emoji need to appear frequently in order to estimate a representation.},

@article{Halevi2015SpearPhishing,
abstract = {Recent research has begun to focus on the factors that cause people to respond to phishing attacks. In this study a real-world spear-phishing attack was performed on employees in organizational settings in order to examine how users' personality, attitudinal and perceived efficacy factors affect their tendency to expose themselves to such an attack. Spear-phishing attacks are more sophisticated than regular phishing attacks as they use personal information about their intended victim and present a stronger challenge for detection by both the potential victims as well as email phishing filters.While previous research showed that certain phishing attacks can lure a higher response rate from people with a higher level of the personality trait of Neuroticism, other traits were not explored in this context. The present study included a field-experiment which revealed a number of factors that increase the likelihood of users falling for a phishing attack: the factor that was found to be most correlated to the phishing response was users' Conscientiousness personality trait. The study also found gender-based difference in the response, with women more likely to respond to a spear-phishing message than men. In addition, this work detected negative correlation between the participants subjective estimate of their own vulnerability to phishing attacks and the likelihood that they will be phished. Put together, the finding suggests that vulnerability to phishing is in part a function of users' personality and that vulnerability is not due to lack of awareness of phishing risks. This implies that real-time response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by the users themselves, and that a targeted approach to defense may increase security effectiveness.},

abstract = {We present a usability study of two recent password manager proposals: PwdHash (Ross et al., 2005) and Password Multiplier (Halderman et al., 2005). Both papers considered usability issues in greater than typical detail, the former briefly reporting on a small usability study; both also provided implementations for download. Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

abstract = {Behavioural biology is a major discipline within biology, centred on the key concept of 'behaviour'. But how is 'behaviour' defined, and how should it be defined? We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract = {Communication research based on social cognition draws heavily from dual process models such as the heuristic-systematic model. Both heuristic and systematic processing are said to be aided by quick rules of thumb or mental shortcuts called heuristics. However, the operationalization of heuristics is quite problematic because their use in decision-making is not directly measured. Scholars claim the operation of specific heuristics in specific situations, based often on clever experimental evidence. We propose a methodological framework that calls for both manipulation and measurement of heuristics in order to offer more direct evidence of their operation. We first review different existing approaches in the literature for operationalizing heuristics. We then discuss our approach and describe the application of moderated mediation to analyze the resulting data. We conclude with a study idea and simulated data that illustrate how our proposed design and analysis framework could be applied in communication research.},

abstract = {Modern password guessing attacks adopt sophisticated prob-abilistic techniques that allow for orders of magnitude less guesses to succeed compared to brute force. Unfortunately, best practices and password strength evaluators failed to keep up: they are generally based on heuristic rules designed to defend against obsolete brute force attacks. Many passwords can only be guessed with significant ef-fort, and motivated attackers may be willing to invest re-sources to obtain valuable passwords. However, it is em-inently impractical for the defender to simulate expensive attacks against each user to accurately characterize their password strength. This paper proposes a novel method to estimate the number of guesses needed to find a password using modern attacks. The proposed method requires little resources, applies to a wide set of probabilistic models, and is characterised by highly desirable convergence properties. The experiments demonstrate the scalability and general-ity of the proposal. In particular, the experimental analysis reports evaluations on a wide range of password strengths, and of state-of-the-art attacks on very large datasets, includ-ing attacks that would have been prohibitively expensive to handle with existing simulation-based approaches.},

@article{Gulenko2014PasswordsEmotion,
abstract = {Purpose – This paper aims to study the influence of emotions on security behaviour by reviewing Information Systems Security (ISS) topics in Information Systems (IS) literature. Researchers in ISS study how to motivate people to adhere to security policies; they mainly focus on cognitive models such as the technology acceptance model (Davis, 1985), innovation diffusion theory (Brancheau and Wetherbe, 1990), theory of planned behaviour (Mathieson, 1991) and social cognitive theory (Compeau and Higgins, 1995). Applying positive emotions such as joy and interest is feasible by adding emoticons and positive messages; we use this approach to improve password choosing. Design/methodology/approach – We apply differential emotional theory (Izard 2002) from psychology to the context of ISS. Twenty-two participants took part in an experiment with the task of choosing strong but memorable passphrases. The dependent variable is the strength of the chosen passphrase. The task for the user is to come up with a passphrase that is both strong and memorable. We choose a between-subject design. The independent variable is the emotional interface that the user is confronted with. Findings – We found that 5.35 words was the mean when participants were shown positive smiley faces and messages. When exposed to negative emoticons, the mean was only 4.35 words. Through ANOVA, we find the differences to be statistically significant (F1; 20?3.16; p?0.1). We derive from the experiment that positive emotions should be used in ISS when making users start a habit (e.g. developing a new, individual password strategy), and we conclude from our literature review that negative emotions should be used when reinforcing a habit (e.g. taking care of shoulder surfing). Originality/value – We contribute to practice by developing a user script that can be installed in all established Internet browsers. The script supports the user to choose a good passphrase strategy when registering for a new service.Wefind that trainings should not rely on facts only but must make use of emotions, which are crucial for human motivation.

@inproceedings{Khern-am-nuai2017ContextBasedMeter,
abstract = {Encouraging users to create stronger passwords has always been one of the key issues in password-based authentication. It is particularly important as passwords are still the most common user authentication method. Furthermore, prior works have highlighted that most passwords are significantly weak. In this paper, we seek to mitigate such an issue by proposing a context-based password strength meter and investigating its effectiveness on users' password generating behavior. We conduct a randomized experiment on Amazon MTurk involving hypothetical account creating scenarios. We observe the change in users' behavior in terms of the number of occasions where users change their password after seeing the warning message, the number of occasions where users want to learn more about creating stronger passwords, and the changes in password strength. We find that our proposed password strength meter is significantly effective. Users exposed to our password strength meter are more likely to change their password, and those new passwords are stronger. Furthermore, if the information is readily available, users are willing to invest their time to learn about creating a stronger password, even in a traditional password strength meter setting. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating a contextual information to password strength meters could be one of potential methods in promoting secure behaviors among end users.},

Thus far, the security and efficiency of these "mental algorithms" has been analyzed only theoretically. But are such methods usable? We present the first usability study of humanly computable password strategies, involving a learning phase (to learn a password strategy), then a rehearsal phase (to login to a few websites), and multiple follow-up tests. In our user study, with training, participants were able to calculate a deterministic eight-character password for an arbitrary new website in under 20 seconds.},

By dividing these users into three groups, our controlled study measured both the effect of extended validation certificates that appear only at legitimate sites and the effect of reading a help file about security features in Internet Explorer 7. Across all groups, we found that picture-in-picture attacks showing a fake browser window were as effective as the best other phishing technique, the homograph attack. Extended validation did not help users identify either attack. Additionally, reading the help file made users more likely to classify both real and fake web sites as legitimate when the phishing warning did not appear.},

@incollection{Haselton,
abstract = {In this chapter, Martie Haselton, Daniel Nettle, and Paul Andrews present theory and empirical research on the evolution of cognitive biases in social interaction. They provide sound arguments that certain social cognitive biases are in fact designed and functional, resulting in better solutions to adaptive problems than cognitive mechanisms that "accurately" detected social signals. They call for an evolutionary reformulation of the entire "heuristics and biases" literature, which typically cast humans as making illogical and unfounded errors. This new line of work has already led to the discovery of new cognitive biases and offers much promise for the future discovery of additional adaptive biases. It also may lead to the detumescence of decades of work that has cast humans erroneously as fundamentally irrational and hopelessly muddled in their judgment and decision making. },

These inference processes may also well operate when judgments about a product's user-experience are made. To examine this, an inference model of user-experience, based on Hassenzahl and Monk's [2010], was explored in three studies using Web sites. All studies supported the model's predictions and its stability, with hands-on experience, different products, and different usage modes (action mode versus goal mode). Within a unified framework of judgment as inference [Kruglanski et al. 2007], our approach allows for the integration of the effects of a wide range of information sources on judgments of user-experience.},

We conducted three between-subjects experiments to test the effectiveness of the attractors. In the first two experiments, we sent participants to per- form a task on what appeared to be a third-party site that required installation of a browser plugin. We presented them with what appeared to be an installation dialog from their operating system. Participants who saw dialogs that em- ployed inhibitive attractors were significantly less likely than those in the control group to ignore clues that installing this software might be harmful. In the third experiment, we attempted to habituate par- ticipants to dialogs that they knew were part of the experi- ment. We used attractors to highlight a field that was of no value during habituation trials and contained critical infor- mation after the habituation period. Participants exposed to inhibitive attractors were two to three times more likely to make an informed decision than those in the control con- dition. Categories},

This meter combines neural networks and numerous carefully com-bined heuristics to score passwords and generate data-driven text feedback about the user's password. We describe the meter's iterative development and final design. We detail the security and usability impact of the meter's design dimensions, examined through a 4,509-participant online study. Under the more common password-composition policy we tested, we found that the data-driven meter with detailed feedback led users to create more secure, and no less memorable, passwords than a meter with only a bar as a strength indicator.},
