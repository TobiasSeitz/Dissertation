abstract = {We report on the largest corpus of user-chosen passwords ever studied, consisting of anonymized password histograms representing almost 70 million Yahoo! users, mitigating privacy concerns while enabling analysis of dozens of subpopulations based on demographic factors and site usage characteristics. This large data set motivates a thorough statistical treatment of estimating guessing difficulty by sampling from a secret distribution. In place of previously used metrics such as Shannon entropy and guessing entropy, which cannot be estimated with any realistically sized sample, we develop partial guessing metrics including a new variant of guesswork parameterized by an attacker's desired success rate. Our new metric is comparatively easy to approximate and directly relevant for security engineering. By comparing password distributions with a uniform distribution which would provide equivalent security against different forms of guessing attack, we estimate that passwords provide fewer than 10 bits of security against an online, trawling attack, and only about 20 bits of security against an optimal offline dictionary attack. We find surprisingly little variation in guessing difficulty; every identifiable group of users generated a comparably weak password distribution. Security motivations such as the registration of a payment card have no greater impact than demographic factors such as age and nationality. Even proactive efforts to nudge users towards better password choices with graphical feedback make little difference. More surprisingly, even seemingly distant language communities choose the same weak passwords and an attacker never gains more than a factor of 2 efficiency gain by switching from the globally optimal dictionary to a population-specific lists.},

Effective security solutions depend not only on the mathematical and technical properties of those solutions, but also on people's ability to understand them and use them as part of their work. As a step towards solving this problem, we have been examining how people experience security as a facet of their daily life, and how they routinely answer the question, "is this system secure enough for what I want to do?" We present a number of findings concerning the scope of security, attitudes towards security, and the social and organizational contexts within which security concerns arise, and point towards emerging technical solutions.},

@article{Bonneau2012ReplacePasswords,
abstract = {We evaluate two decades of proposals to replace text passwords for general-purpose user authentication on the web using a broad set of twenty-five usability, deployability and security benefits that an ideal scheme might provide. The scope of proposals we survey is also extensive, including password management software, federated login protocols, graphical password schemes, cognitive authentication schemes, one-time passwords, hardware tokens, phone-aided schemes and biometrics. Our comprehensive approach leads to key insights about the difficulty of replacing passwords. Not only does no known scheme come close to providing all desired benefits: none even retains the full set of benefits that legacy passwords already provide. In particular, there is a wide range from schemes offering minor security benefits beyond legacy passwords, to those offering significant security benefits in return for being more costly to deploy or more difficult to use. We conclude that many academic proposals have failed to gain traction because researchers rarely consider a sufficiently wide range of real-world constraints. Beyond our analysis of current schemes, our framework provides an evaluation methodology and benchmark for future web authentication proposals.},

There is however a severe lack of scientific data on users' current unlocking behavior and perceptions. We performed an online survey (n = 260) and a one-month field study (n = 52) to gain insights into real world (un)locking behavior of smartphone users. One of the main goals was to find out how much overhead unlocking and authenticating adds to the overall phone usage and in how many unlock interactions security (i.e. authentication) was perceived as necessary. We also investigated why users do or do not use a lock screen and how they cope with smartphone-related risks, such as shouldersurfing or unwanted accesses. Among other results, we found that on average, participants spent around 2.9 {\%} of their smartphone interaction time with authenticating (9 {\%} in the worst case). Participants that used a secure lock screen like PIN or Android unlock patterns considered it unnecessary in 24.1 {\%} of situations. Shoulder surfing was perceived to be a relevant risk in only 11 of 3410 sampled situations.},

abstract = {Challenging the conventional wisdom that users cannot remember cryptographically-strong secrets, we test the hypothesis that users can learn randomly-assigned 56- bit codes (encoded as either 6 words or 12 characters) through spaced repetition. We asked remote research participants to perform a distractor task that required log- ging into a website 90 times, over up to two weeks, with a password of their choosing. After they entered their chosen password correctly we displayed a short code (4 letters or 2 words, 18.8 bits) that we required them to type. For subsequent logins we added an increasing de- lay prior to displaying the code, which participants could avoid by typing the code from memory. As participants learned, we added two more codes to comprise a 56.4- bit secret. Overall, 94{\%} of participants eventually typed their entire secret from memory, learning it after a me- dian of 36 logins. The learning component of our system added a median delay of just 6.9 s per login and a to- tal of less than 12 minutes over an average of ten days. 88{\%} were able to recall their codes exactly when asked at least three days later, with only 21{\%} reporting having written their secret down. As one participant wrote with surprise, “the words are branded into my brain.” While our study is preliminary in nature, we believe it debunks the myth that users are inherently incapable of remem- bering cryptographically-strong secrets for a select few high-stakes scenarios, such as a password for enterprise login or as a master key to protect other credentials (e.g., in a password manager).},

annote = {1. What did the authors do?
- the authors propose a system that lets the users choose their own authentication scheme.
- available schemes: Persuasive Text Passwords, Persuasive Cued Click Points, object passtiles, text passwords (baseline)
2. How did they do it?
- the conducted a small, 2 week user study with 39 participants who were prompted to log in to web sites from the MVP web-auth framework (see [5]). 

3. What was their goal?
- find evidence for/against hypotheses: h1: user do not prefer one over the other; h2: the users first take the time to learn sth about the available schemes; h3: users like CYOA

4. What are the results?
- surprise surprise: all hypotheses were confirmed. 
- users avoided Persuasive Text Password for their second account. 
- no preference of text passwords
- when people tried out a novel scheme, they switched back to text passwords and vice versa.
- users who spend more time reading the intro, were more likely to use novel schemes.
- users don't base their choice on security concerns.
- users did not switch their chosen scheme when resetting.

5. What could be improved?
- the conclusions are clearly flawed.
- the participants simply were open-minded study participants who also would behave differently in real life. 
- the statistics are traditional hypothesis tests that cannot be taken too seriously with this N
- within two weeks for artificial, uninteresting accounts it's no surprise that users did not reset their passwords / schemes. 
- the chosen schemes were all published by the authors and no one else likes them. authors were clearly biased in favor of them. 

Ah. The idea is great, but I really hate how they put it into practice and what they claim with their study. They could have done better.

We explore how choice architecture affects smartphone users' stated willingness to install applications that request varying permissions. We performed two experiments to gauge smartphone users' stated willingness to pay premiums to limit their personal information exposure when installing applications. When participants were comparison shopping between multiple applications that performed similar functionality, a quarter of our sample indicated a willingness to pay a {\$}1.50 premium for the application that requested the fewest permissions—though only when viewing the requested permissions of each application side-by-side. In a second experiment, we more closely simulated the user experience by asking them to valuate a single application that featured multiple sets of permissions based on five between-subjects conditions. In this scenario, the requested permissions had a much smaller impact. Our results suggest that many smartphone users are concerned with their privacy and are willing to pay premiums for applications that are less likely to request access to personal information, but that the current choice architectures do not support this. We propose improvements for smartphone application markets that could result in decreased satisficing and increased rational behavior.},

Self-awareness induced by the presence of a mirror placed behind the candy bowl decreased transgression rates for children who had been individuated by asking them their name and address, but did not affect the behavior of children left anonymous. Self-awareness influenced older but not younger children. Naturally occurring standards instituted by the behavior of the first child to approach the candy bowl in each group were shown to interact with the experimenter's verbally stated standard. The behavior of 349 subjects in the second study replicated the findings in the first study. Additionally, when no standard was stated by the experimenter, children took more candy when not self-aware than when self-aware.},

abstract = {Context-sensitive guidance (CSG) can help users make better security decisions. Applications with CSG ask the user to provide relevant context information. Based on such information, these applications then decide or suggest an appropriate course of action. However, users often deem security dialogs irrelevant to the tasks they are performing and try to evade them. This paper contributes two new techniques for hardening CSG against automatic and false user answers. Polymorphic dialogs continuously change the form of required user inputs and intentionally delay the latter, forcing users to pay attention to security decisions. Audited dialogs thwart false user answers by (1) warning users that their answers will be forwarded to auditors, and (2) allowing auditors to quarantine users who provide unjustified answers. We implemented CSG against email-borne viruses on the Thunderbird email agent. One version, CSG-PD, includes CSG and polymorphic dialogs. Another version, CSG-PAD, includes CSG and both polymorphic and audited dialogs. In user studies, we found that untrained users accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PD than with conventional dialogs. Moreover, they accept significantly less unjustified risks with CSG-PAD than with CSG-PD. CSG-PD and CSG-PAD have insignificant effect on acceptance of justified risks.},

abstract = {When browsing the Internet, users are likely to be exposed to security and privacy threats – like fraudulent websites. Automatic browser mechanisms can protect them only to some extent. In other situations it is still important to raise the users' security awareness at the right moment. Passive indicators are mostly overlooked and blocking warnings are quickly dismissed by habituated users. In this work, we present a new concept of warnings that appear in-context, right next to data the user has just entered. Those dialogs are displayed whenever critical data types – e.g. credit card data – are entered by the users into online forms. Since they do not immediately interrupt the users' interaction but appear right in the users' focus, it is possible to place im- portant security information in a way that it can be easily seen. We implemented the concept as a Firefox plugin and eval- uated it in a row of studies including two lab studies, one focus group and one real world study. Results show that the concept is very well accepted by the users and that with the plugin, especially non-expert participants were more likely to identify fraudulent (or phishing) websites than using the standard browser warnings. Besides this, we were able to gather interesting findings on warning usage.},

A study of banking and security in Australia shows that the practice of sharing passwords does not conform to this requirement.

Sharing Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) is a common practice among remote indigenous communities in Australia. In areas with poor banking access, this is the only way to access cash. People with certain disabilities have to share passwords with carers, and PIN numbers with retail clerks. In this paper we present the findings of a qualitative user study of banking and money management. We suggest design criteria for banking security systems, based on observed social and cultural practices of password and PIN number sharing.},

This paper reports on research undertaken to determine whether a more prominent display of privacy information will cause consumers to incorporate privacy considerations into their online purchasing decisions. We designed an experiment in which a shopping search engine interface clearly and compactly displays privacy policy information. When such information is made available, consumers tend to purchase from online retailers who better protect their privacy. In fact, our study indicates that when privacy information is made more salient and accessible, some consumers are willing to pay a premium to purchase from privacy protective websites. This result suggests that businesses may be able to leverage privacy protection as a selling point.},

abstract = {Password restriction policies and advice on creating secure passwords have limited effects on password strength. Influencing users to create more secure passwords remains an open problem. We have developed Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP), a text password creation system which leverages Persuasive Technology principles to influence users in creating more secure passwords without sacrificing usability. After users choose a password during creation, PTP improves its security by placing randomly-chosen characters at random positions into the password. Users may shuffle to be presented with randomly-chosen and positioned characters until they find a combination they feel is memorable. In this paper, we present an 83-participant user study testing four PTP variations. Our results show that the PTP variations significantly improved the security of users' passwords. We also found that those participants who had a high number of random characters placed into their passwords would deliberately choose weaker pre-improvement passwords to compensate for the memory load. As a consequence of this compensatory behaviour, there was a limit to the gain in password security achieved by PTP.},

abstract = {User errors cause or contribute to most computer security failures, yet user interfaces for security still tend to be clumsy, confusing, or near-nonexistent. Is this simply due to a failure to apply standard user interface design techniques to security? We argue that, on the contrary, effective security requires a different usability standard, and that it will not be achieved through the user interface design techniques appropriate to other types of consumer software. To test this hypothesis, we performed a case study of a security program which does have a good user interface by general standards: PGP 5.0. Our case study used a cognitive walkthrough analysis together with a laboratory user test to evaluate whether PGP 5.0 can be successfully used by cryptography novices to achieve effective electronic mail security. The analysis found a number of user interface design flaws that may contribute to security failures, and the user test demonstrated that when our test participants were given 90 minutes in which to sign and encrypt a message using PGP 5.0, the majority of them were unable to do so successfully. We conclude that PGP 5.0 is not usable enough to provide effective security for most computer users, despite its attractive graphical user interface, supporting our hypothesis that user interface design for effective security remains an open problem. We close with a brief description of our continuing work on the development and application of user interface design principles and techniques for security.},

Habits emerge from the gradual learning of associations between responses and the features of performance contexts that have historically covaried with them (e.g., physical settings, preceding actions). Once a habit is formed, perception of contexts triggers the associated response without a mediating goal. Nonetheless, habits interface with goals. Constraining this interface, habit associations accrue slowly and do not shift appreciably with current goal states or infrequent counterhabitual responses. Given these constraints, goals can (a) direct habits by motivating repetition that leads to habit formation and by promoting exposure to cues that trigger habits, (b) be inferred from habits, and (c) interact with habits in ways that preserve the learned habit associations. Finally, the authors outline the implications of the model for habit change, especially for the self-regulation of habit cuing.},

We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves, each other and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of 'behaviour'. We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes. Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition. ?? 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Most researchers who conduct password user studies try to address the issue in their study design. However, the methods researchers use to try to improve ecological validity vary and some methods even contradict each other. One reason for this is that the very nature of the problem of ecological validity of password studies is hard to study, due to the lack of ground truth. In this paper, we present a study on the ecological validity of password studies designed specifically to shed light on this issue. We were able to compare the behavior of 645 study participants with their real world password choices. We conducted both online and laboratory studies, under priming and non-priming conditions, to be able to evaluate the effects of these different forms of password studies. While our study is able to investigate only one specific password environment used by a limited population and thus cannot answer all questions about ecological validity, it does represent a first important step in judging the impact of ecological validity on password studies.},

The lack of adoption of privacy enhancing technologies is explained as a societal failure, i.e., that people don??t care. Security designers consider the individual user to be rational, certain, and self-optimizing. Thus, academic and practitioner efforts have focused on incentive alignment and education. But even the effectiveness of initiatives such as security education can be improved if well-known human decision heuristics are taken as initial inputs to improve technical solutions, rather than sources of failure to be bemoaned.},

This article summarizes research on self-initiated and professionally facilitated change of addictive behaviors using the key trans-theoretical constructs of stages and processes of change. Modification of addictive behaviors involves progression through five stages--pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance--and individuals typically recycle through these stages several times before termination of the addiction. Multiple studies provide strong support for these stages as well as for a finite and common set of change processes used to progress through the stages. Research to date supports a trans-theoretical model of change that systematically integrates the stages with processes of change from diverse theories of psychotherapy.},

abstract = {We present the results of an experiment examining the extent to which individuals will tolerate delays when told that such delays are for security purposes. In our experiment, we asked 400 Amazon Mechanical Turk users to count the total number of times a certain term was repeated in a multi-page document. The task was designed to be conducive to cheating. We assigned subjects to four between-subjects conditions: one of these offered a concrete security reason (virus-scanning) for the delay, another offered only a vague security explanation, another did not mention security at all, and a control condition without a delay. We found that subjects were significantly more likely to cheat or abandon the task when provided no explanation or a vague security explanation for the delay. However, when subjects were provided more explanation about the threat model and the protection ensured by the delay, they were not more likely to cheat than subjects in the control condition who faced no such delay. Our results thus contribute to the nascent literature on soft paternalistic solutions to security and privacy problems by suggesting that, when security mitigations cannot be made “free” for users, designers may incentivize compliant users' behavior by intentionally drawing attention to the mitigation itself.},

Our study of 49 undergraduates quanti¯es how many passwords they had and how often they reused these passwords. The majority of users had three or fewer passwords and passwords were reused twice. Furthermore, over time, password reuse rates increased because people accumulated more accounts but did not create more passwords. Users justi¯ed their habits. While they wanted to protect ¯nancial data and personal communication, reusing passwords made passwords easier to manage. Users visualized threats from human attackers, particularly viewing those close to them as the most moti- vated and able attackers; however, participants did not sep- arate the human attackers from their potentially automated tools. They sometimes failed to realize that personalized passwords such as phone numbers can be cracked given a large enough dictionary and enough tries. We discuss how current systems support poor password practices. We also present potential changes in website authentication systems and password managers.},

abstract = {Usable security has unique usability challenges because the need for security often means that standard human-computer-interaction approaches cannot be directly applied. An important usability goal for authentication systems is to support users in selecting better passwords, thus increasing security by expanding the effective password space. In click-based graphical passwords, poorly chosen passwords lead to the emergence of hotspots portions of the image where users are more likely to select click-points, allowing attackers to mount more successful dictionary attacks. We use persuasion to influence user choice in click-based graphical passwords, encouraging users to select more random, and hence more secure, click-points. Our approach is to introduce persuasion to the Cued Click-Points graphical password scheme (Chiasson, van Oorschot, Biddle, 2007). Our resulting scheme significantly reduces hotspots while still maintaining its usability.},

We argue that password mechanisms and their users form a socio-technical system, whose effectiveness relies strongly on users' willingness to make the extra effort that security-censcious behavior requires. In most organizations, users cannot be forced to comply; rather, they have to be persuaded to do so. Ultimately, the mechanisms themselves, policies, tutorials, training and the general discourse have to be designed with their persuasive power in mind.

abstract = {Entering a username-password combination is a widely used procedure for identification and authentication in computer systems. However, it is a notoriously weak method, in that the passwords adopted by many users are easy to crack. In an attempt to improve security, proactive password checking may be used, in which passwords must meet several criteria to be more resistant to cracking. In two experiments, we examined the influence of proactive password restrictions on the time that it took to generate an acceptable password and to use it subsequently to long in. The required length was a minimum of five characters in Experiment 1 and eight characters in Experiment 2. In both experiments, one condition had only the length restriction, and the other had additional restrictions. The additional restrictions greatly increased the time it took to generate the password but had only a small effect on the time it took to use it subsequently to long in. For the five-character passwords, 75{\%} were cracked when no other restrictions were imposed, and this was reduced to 33{\%} with the additional restrictions. For the eight-character passwords, 17{\%} were cracked with no other restrictions, and 12.5{\%} with restrictions. The results indicate that increasing the minimum character length reduces crackability and increases security, regardless of whether additional restrictions are imposed.},

Strong passwords do nothing to protect online users from password stealing attacks such as phishing and keylogging, and yet they place considerable burden on users. Passwords that are too weak of course invite brute-force attacks. However, we find that relatively weak passwords, about 20 bits or so, are sufficient to make brute-force attacks on a single account unrealistic so long as a "three strikes" type rule is in place. Above that minimum it appears that increasing password strength does little to address any real threat. If a larger credential space is needed it appears better to increase the strength of the userID's rather than the passwords. For large institutions this is just as effective in deterring bulk guessing attacks and is a great deal better for users. For small institutions there appears little reason to require strong passwords for online accounts.},

abstract = {An important example of the influence of context on elicited values and choice is the effect of asymmetrically dominated alternatives, first studied by Huber, Payne, and Puto (1982). A theory of dynamic choice reconstruction is presented to account for this effect. The theory is based on ideas of dominance seeking, in which the decision maker actively looks for ways to simplify the task. Results of three experiments showed that the relationship of an irrelevant alternative to others in the choice set influences the weights of the different dimensions as well as the values of the different items. The results support the claim that values depend on local relationships in a way that is consistent with the theory.},

abstract = {This paper explores a judgmental heuristic in which a person evaluates the frequency of classes or the probability of events by availability, i.e., by the ease with which relevant instances come to mind. In general, availability is correlated with ecological frequency, but it is also affected by other factors. Consequently, the reliance on the availability heuristic leads to systematic biases. Such biases are demonstrated in the judged frequency of classes of words, of combinatorial outcomes, and of repeated events. The phenomenon of illusory correlation is explained as an availability bias. The effects of the availability of incidents and scenarios on subjective probability are discussed.},

Password managers offer some improvement without requiring server-side changes. In this paper, we evaluate the security of dual-possession authentication, an authentication approach offering encrypted storage of passwords and theft-resistance without the use of a master password. We further introduce Tapas, a concrete implementation of dual-possession authentication leveraging a desktop computer and a smartphone. Tapas requires no server-side changes to websites, no master password, and protects all the stored passwords in the event either the primary or secondary device (e.g., computer or phone) is stolen. To evaluate the viability of Tapas as an alternative to traditional password managers, we perform a 30 participant user study comparing Tapas to two configurations of Firefox's built-in password manager. We found users significantly preferred Tapas. We then improve Tapas by incorporating feedback from this study, and reevaluate it with an additional 10 participants. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Both papers considered usability issues in greater than typical detail, the former briefly reporting on a small usability study; both also provided implementations for download. Our study involving 26 users found that both proposals suffer from major usability problems. Some of these are not "simply" usability issues, but rather lead directly to security exposures. Not surprisingly, we found the most significant problems arose from users having inaccurate or incomplete mental models of the software. Our study revealed many interesting misunderstandings D for example, users reporting a task as easy even when unsuccessful at completing that task; and believing their passwords were being strengthened when in fact they had failed to engage the appropriate protection mechanism. Our findings also suggested that ordinary users would be reluctant to optin to using these managers: users were uncomfortable with "relinquishing control" of their passwords to a manager, did not feel that they needed the password managers, or that the managers provided greater security.},

We performed a laboratory experiment to examine whether these meters influenced users' password selections when they were forced to change their real passwords, and when they were not told that their passwords were the subject of a study. We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on "important" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.},

Given the risks of using weak passwords, there is a need to effectively motivate users to select strong passwords. In this study we examine the influence of interactivity, as well as static and interactive fear appeals, on motivating users to increase the strength of their passwords. We developed a field experiment involving the account registration process of a website in use in which we observed the strength of passwords chosen by users. Data were collected from 354 users in 65 countries. We found that while the interactive password strength meter and static fear appeal treatments were not effective, the interactive fear appeal treatment resulted in significantly stronger passwords. Our findings suggest that interactive fear appeals are a promising means of encouraging a range of secure behaviors in end users.},

abstract = {Despite considerable research on passwords, empirical studies of password strength have been limited by lack of access to plaintext passwords, small data sets, and password sets specifically collected for a research study or from low-value accounts. Properties of passwords used for high-value accounts thus remain poorly understood. We fill this gap by studying the single-sign-on passwords used by over 25,000 faculty, staff, and students at a research university with a complex password policy. Key aspects of our contributions rest on our (indirect) access to plaintext passwords. We describe our data collection methodology, particularly the many precautions we took to minimize risks to users. We then analyze how guessable the collected passwords would be during an offline attack by subjecting them to a state-of-the-art password cracking algorithm. We discover significant correlations between a number of demographic and behavioral factors and password strength. For example, we find that users associated with the computer science school make passwords more than 1.5 times as strong as those of users associated with the business school. while users associated with computer science make strong ones. In addition, we find that stronger passwords are correlated with a higher rate of errors entering them. We also compare the guessability and other characteristics of the passwords we analyzed to sets previously collected in controlled experiments or leaked from low-value accounts. We find more consistent similarities between the university passwords and passwords collected for research studies under similar composition policies than we do between the university passwords and subsets of passwords leaked from low-value accounts that happen to comply with the same policies.},

In a 1,476-participant online study, we explored the usability of 3- and 4-word system- assigned passphrases in comparison to system-assigned passwords composed of 5 to 6 random characters, and 8-character system- assigned pronounceable passwords. Contrary to expectations, sys- tem-assigned passphrases performed similarly to system-assigned passwords of similar entropy across the usability metrics we ex- amined. Passphrases and passwords were forgotten at similar rates, led to similar levels of user difficulty and annoyance, and were both written down by a majority of participants. However, passphrases took significantly longer for participants to enter, and appear to require error-correction to counteract entry mistakes. Passphrase usability did not seem to increase when we shrunk the dictionary from which words were chosen, reduced the number of words in a passphrase, or allowed users to change the order of words.},

We present a 2,931-subject study of password creation in the presence of 14 password meters. We found that meters with a variety of visual appearances led users to create longer passwords. However, significant increases in resistance to a password-cracking algorithm were only achieved using meters that scored passwords stringently. These stringent meters also led participants to include more digits, symbols, and uppercase letters. Password meters also affected the act of password cre- ation. Participants who sawstringent meters spent longer creating their password and were more likely to change their password while entering it, yet they were also more likely to find the password meter annoying. However, the most stringent meter and those without visual bars caused participants to place less importance on satisfy- ing the meter. Participants who saw more lenient meters tried to fill the meter and were averse to choosing pass- words a meter deemed “bad” or “poor.” Our findings can serve as guidelines for administrators seeking to nudge users towards stronger passwords.},

abstract = {Text-based passwords are the most common mechanism for authenticating humans to computer systems. To prevent users from picking passwords that are too easy for an adversary to guess, system administrators adopt password-composition policies (e.g., requiring passwords to contain symbols and numbers). Unfortunately, little is known about the relationship between password-composition policies and the strength of the resulting passwords, or about the behavior of users (e.g., writing down passwords) in response to different policies. We present a large-scale study that investigates password strength, user behavior, and user sentiment across four password-composition policies. We characterize the predictability of passwords by calculating their entropy, and find that a number of commonly held beliefs about password composition and strength are inaccurate. We correlate our results with user behavior and sentiment to produce several recommendations for password-composition policies that result in strong passwords without unduly burdening users.},

abstract = {HCI research published 10 years ago pointed out that many users cannot cope with the number and complexity of passwords, and resort to insecure workarounds as a consequence. We present a study which re-examined password policies and password practice in the workplace today. 32 staff members in two organisations kept a password diary for 1 week, which produced a sample of 196 passwords. The diary was followed by an interview which covered details of each password, in its context of use. We find that users are in general concerned to maintain security, but that existing security policies are too inflexible to match their capabilities, and the tasks and contexts in which they operate. As a result, these password policies can place demands on users which impact negatively on their productivity and, ultimately, that of the organisation. We conclude that, rather than focussing password policies on maximizing password strength and enforcing frequency alone, policies should be designed using HCI principles to help the user to set an appropriately strong password in a specific context of use.},

These data sets were collected from several different websites, the largest one containing over 32 million passwords. This focus on actual attack methodologies and real user passwords quite possibly makes this one of the largest studies on password security to date. In addition we examine what these results mean for standard password creation policies, such as minimum password length, and character set requirements.},

abstract = {With an increasing number of organizations allowing per- sonal smart phones onto their networks, considerable secu- rity risk is introduced. The security risk is exacerbated by the tremendous heterogeneity of the personal mobile devices and their respective installed pool of applications. Further- more, by virtue of the devices not being owned by the orga- nization, the ability to authoritatively enforce organizational security polices is challenging. As a result, a critical part of organizational security is the ability to drive user security behavior through either on-device mechanisms or security awareness programs. In this paper, we establish a base- line for user security behavior from a population of over one hundred fifty smart phone users. We then systematically evaluate the ability to drive behavioral change via messag- ing centered on morality, deterrence, and incentives. Our findings suggest that appeals to morality are most effective over time, whereas deterrence produces the most immediate reaction. Additionally, our findings show that while a sig- nificant portion of users are securing their devices without prior intervention, it is difficult to influence change in those who do not.},

@inproceedings{Herley2009SoLongThanksExternalities,
abstract = {It is often suggested that users are hopelessly lazy and unmotivated on security questions. They chose weak passwords, ignore security warnings, and are oblivious to certificates errors. We argue that users' rejection of the security advice they receive is entirely rational from an economic perspective. The advice offers to shield them from the direct costs of attacks, but burdens them with far greater indirect costs in the form of effort. Looking at various examples of security advice we find that the advice is complex and growing, but the benefit is largely speculative or moot. For example, much of the advice concerning passwords is outdated and does little to address actual treats, and fully 100{\%} of certificate error warnings appear to be false positives. Further, if users spent even a minute a day reading URLs to avoid phishing, the cost (in terms of user time) would be two orders of magnitude greater than all phishing losses. Thus we find that most security advice simply offers a poor cost-benefit tradeoff to users and is rejected. Security advice is a daily burden, applied to the whole population, while an upper bound on the benefit is the harm suffered by the fraction that become victims annually. When that fraction is small, designing security advice that is beneficial is very hard. For example, it makes little sense to burden all users with a daily task to spare 0.01{\%} of them a modest annual pain.},

abstract = {We examine the password policies of 75 different web- sites. Our goal is understand the enormous diversity of requirements: some will accept simple six-character passwords, while others impose rules of great complex- ity on their users. We compare different features of the sites to find which characteristics are correlated with stronger policies. Our results are surprising: greater security demands do not appear to be a factor. The size of the site, the number of users, the value of the assets protected and the frequency of attacks show no correlation with strength. In fact we find the reverse: some of the largest, most attacked sites with greatest assets allow relatively weak passwords. Instead, we find that those sites that accept advertising, purchase spon- sored links and where the user has a choice show strong inverse correlation with strength. We conclude that the sites with the most restrictive password policies do not have greater security concerns, they are simply better insulated from the consequences of poor usability. Online retailers and sites that sell ad- vertising must compete vigorously for users and traffic. In contrast to government and university sites, poor us- ability is a luxury they cannot afford. This in turn sug- gests that much of the extra strength demanded by the more restrictive policies is superfluous: it causes con- siderable inconvenience for negligible security improve- ment.},

abstract = {OpenID and InfoCard are two mainstream Web single sign- on (SSO) solutions intended for Internet-scale adoption. While they are technically sound, the business model of these solu- tions does not provide content-hosting and service providers (CSPs) with sucient incentives to become relying parties (RPs). In addition, the pressure from users and identity providers (IdPs) is not strong enough to drive CSPs toward adopting Web SSO. As a result, there are currently over one billion OpenID-enabled user accounts provided by ma- jor CSPs, but only a few relying parties. In this paper, we discuss the problem of Web SSO adop- tion for RPs and argue that solutions in this space must of- fer RPs sucient business incentives and trustworthy iden- tity services in order to succeed. We suggest future Web SSO development should investigate and ful ll RPs' busi- ness needs, identify IdP business models, and build trust frameworks. Moreover, we propose that Web SSO technol- ogy should build identity support into browsers in order to facilitate RPs' adoption.},
