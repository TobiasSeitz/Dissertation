\section{Background and Context}

Goal: influence / correct mental models of password strength, persuade users to consider alternative strategies. 

Criticism: this is unrealistic because memory interference effects prevent that this works for more than one account. -- yes, but for important accounts, this might still be worthwhile and people can more easily write down three words instead of an 8 character random sequence that might include ambiguous characters (0 and O); Kuo et al also say that writing down is a perfectly valid strategy \cite{Kuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic}. (\todo{look up more researchers who argue in favor of writign down, e.g \cite{Kothari2017PasswordLogbooks} })

\subsection{The Decoy Effect}
The decoy effect was discovered through research in consumer psychology. Buying a product usually involves deciding between different alternatives. On a high level, products are easily comparable by their quality and price, so customers heavily rely on these two metrics. The two dimensions also build the foundation of the decoy effect. In one of the first experiments on ``asymmetric dominance'', Huber \etal illustrate decision-making processes with a simple example to decide between six-packs of beer that differ in price and quality \cite{Huber1982AsymetricallyDominated} (slightly adapted for simplicity): 
\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
	\textbf{Option} & \textbf{Price} & \textbf{Quality rating}\\
	(A) & \$4 & 50 /100\\
	(B) & \$6 & 70 /100\\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

While option (A) is cheaper than (B), it is also lower in quality. Spending \$2 more, the buyer will get a higher-quality beer (B). With the information available at this point, it is hard to decide. 
Buyers may have a general preference for either lower price, or higher quality if all other factors are excluded. Imagine the vendor wants to sell more of beer (A) because margins are higher for that product. To achieve this, Huber \etal explored different ways of adding a third option:
\begin{table}[!h]
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
	\textbf{Option} & \textbf{Price} & \textbf{Quality rating}\\
	(A) & \$4 & 50 /100 \\
	(B) & \$6 & 70 /100\\
	(C) & \$4 & 40 /100 \\
\end{tabular} 
\end{table}

Product (C) is as expensive as (A), but falls behind in quality. Thus, buyers will make a ``better deal'' if they choose option (A) by comparison with (C). Options (B) and (C) are more difficult to compare, because both dimensions (price and quality) are higher in (B) and make it appear like an outlier. Option (C) is thus called the \textbf{decoy} that is \textit{dominated} by option (A) (\textbf{target}). Option (B) (the \textbf{competitor}) also beats the decoy, but the comparability between the target and the decoy boosts the favorability of the target. This is exactly what Huber \etal found, and which was later confirmed numerous times in different decision-making scenarios \cite{Ariely1995ExplanationSubjectiveDominance}. Adding the decoy has the potential to reverse existing preferences, making it a powerful tool for marketing and sales. The decoy itself often serves the sole purpose of making another item stand out, thus the underlying persuasion principles are \textbf{salience} and \textbf{framing}. Constructing the dimensions in a certain way is referred to as \textit{choice architecture} \cite{Thaler2010ChoiceArchitecture}, and is an important persuasive design strategy. 

Huber \etal stated that there is a specific combination of attributes to position the decoy (see Figure \ref{fig:decoy:general-construction}). Depending on the target, the decoy acts as range increasing (R, R*), frequency increasing (F), or both (RF). By extending the range on the dimension on which the \textit{competitor} is superior, the fixed difference between all items on that dimension is weighed less. Figure \ref{fig:decoy:beer-construction} illustrates this type of decoy placement for the sixpack example. The range of the quality is clearer after the decoy is added: before the span was [50;70], and afterwards [40;70]. The superiority of the competitor appears less significant, hence the higher price can seem unjustified.

\subsubsection{Example: Decoy Effects in the Real World}
Huber \etal's example has been adapted and used in the design of user interfaces. The vendor, i.e. a service provider, tries to steer users towards a particular direction that they see as favorable. For instance, location settings on an Android device show signs of a decoy pattern (see Figure \ref{fig:decoy:android-pattern}). From bottom to top, the ``device only'' mode activates the GPS module to determine the device's location. It is thus highly accurate outside of buildings, but does not work well inside. On the other hand, the ``battery saving mode'' works in both environments by using Google's online location services based on triangulation between network cells and surrounding WiFis. In urban areas and even inside buildings, it can achieve great accuracy, while it only roughly estimates locations in rural areas. The two accuracy-levels are thus comparable, but the ``battery saving mode'' does not require powering up additional antennae and modules, giving it a graspable advantage. The ``High accuracy'' mode combines both approaches and is thus the most battery consuming, but most versatile option. The ``battery saving'' can be seen as the target, because it provides the best trade-off in most situations. The ``device only'' mode is the decoy because it uses more battery, while the ``high accuracy'' mode is the competitor. Google requires the user to allow the collection of technical sensor data for the ``high accuracy'' and ``battery saving'' mode. Battery consumption is likely more important to users than location accuracy, which further suggests that the ``battery saving'' mode is indeed the targeted setting.

\section{Designing Password Choice Architecture}
% Briefly point to first exploration report to mention a design that failed. 
We aimed to craft a nudge that persuades users to create stronger passwords. Respecting the principle of the opportune moment, we opted for account creation contexts. To emulate a situation that is comparable to buying one out of several product alternatives, we show suggestions beneath the password field where the user enters their choice (see Figure \ref{fig:decoy:design-architecture-prolific}). We ended up with this design after identifying opportunities of strength feedback on the user's password and on the suggestions (i.e. feed-forward). To that end, we had created several prototypical choice architectures and rapidly evaluated them in the lab and online (see technical report \cite{Seitz2016DecoyEffectReport}). The final architecture is based on Huber \etal's framework (see Figure \ref{fig:decoy:dimensions-prolific}).

\begin{figure}[t]
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\textwidth}
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/decoy/generator_prolific_3}
	\end{subfigure}
	\begin{subfigure}[t]{0.49\textwidth}

	\end{subfigure}
	\caption{\label{fig:decoy:design-architecture-prolific}Choice architecture and decoy placement as evaluated in the online experiment. } 
\end{figure}

The key to the final choice architecture is the user's own password. It has to be the \textbf{competitor}. Service providers will accept the competitor-password in any case, because they want the user to sign up. On the other hand, they want to avoid attacks on user accounts, which is why they likely encourage using a stronger password. This is the \textbf{target}. In our design, we opted for a \textit{passphrase} as target for several reasons: only few users create secure passphrases as their primary credentials; passphrases provide usability and memorability benefits; self-selected passphrases often do not provide the desired security benefits, which can be mitigated by supplying users with a combination of random words. 

To make the passphrase preferable over the competitor, a decoy needs to be carefully positioned along the two dimensions such that it is closer to the target than to the competitor. Moreover, it needs to be dominated at least in one dimension by the target. To achieve this, we identified ``ease of use'' and ``security benefits'' as two feasible dimensions of the choice architecture. We opted for a range-frequency decoy (see Figure \ref{fig:decoy:general-construction}) that the target dominates in \textit{both} dimensions, because effects are more likely to be detected this way. A typical-length \textit{mangled} password fulfills the criteria. The richer character set includes symbols that require the Shift/Alt keys to enter them. Thus, the ease of creation is lower than that of a passphrase (dimension 1). At the same time, typical mangling strategies only slightly contribute to password strength, which we confirmed in Chapter \cite{chap:pasdjo}. Passphrases are considered stronger by several estimators. Consequently, mangled passwords are dominated by passphrases regarding strength (dimension 2). Figure \ref{fig:decoy:dimensions-prolific} illustrates the positioning along the two dimensions.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{The Ineffectiveness of the Decoy Effect}
- users were still unaware of the two dimensions: usability and security. the ease of use was still too low to compete against their own passwords. 

\subsection{Creativity Support}
As we have seen in chapter \ref{chap:pasdjo}, users know fairly well what makes a strong password. Thus, we can explain the stronger influence of the passphrase in several ways. There might be a gap between password strength perception and selection that is due to \textit{creativity}. It might be easier for people to decide upon a stronger password if they actually see it. This, however, will not work, if the password is absolutely unrelated to the person because this increases memorization efforts. 

Creativity is usually associated with the ``Openness'' personality trait (see chapter \ref{chap:pws_and_personality}). So we can suspect that people who show less of this trait might be more susceptible to a password suggestion. 

mental model influenced? -- look at qualitative data.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Application Areas}
it is not feasible to make users pick strong passwords for all accounts.
they already keep a list of ``important'' accounts that they wish to protect well, but stay in charge, so picking a strong memorable password for this type of account is vital to them. 

also, master passwords as gate-keeper to a larger number of passwords. 

\subsection{Personas}
which personas might be most most receptive to suggestions?

\section{Conclusion}

The idea we put forward in \cite{Seitz2016DecoyEffect} (see Figure \ref{fig:decoy:expiremockup}) was very recently evaluated by Renaud and Zimmermann \cite{Renaud2018NudgingFolks}. They concluded that providing a graspable benefit is the key to effectively nudge users towards stronger passwords.
