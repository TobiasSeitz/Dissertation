%TODO Result summary. 
\section{Background and Context}


Criticism: this is unrealistic because memory interference effects prevent that this works for more than one account. -- yes, but for important accounts, this might still be worthwhile and people can more easily write down three words instead of an 8 character random sequence that might include ambiguous characters (0 and O); Kuo et al also say that writing down is a perfectly valid strategy \cite{Kuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic}. (\todo{look up more researchers who argue in favor of writign down, e.g \cite{Kothari2017PasswordLogbooks} })
