\chapter[Password Personality]{Understanding Password Selection Through the Lens of Personality Traits}\label{chap:pws_and_personality}

%\section{Introduction}
% general introduction
% show that not *everyone* does the same
% selection is an individual task, not everyone selects passwords in the same way
Although there are certain patterns, password selection is a task that each individual handles in their own way. 
% even perception differs.
We have shown in chapter \ref{chap:pasdjo} that password strength is even subjectively \textit{evaluated} differently depending on certain characteristics. Again, while there was an overall tendency, we were not able to break down the strength ratings by individual differences: was there a special user group who performed better than others in the game? What characterizes this user group? Moreover, our previous chapter shed light on password policies in the wild. In a few notable cases, the rules were challenging and reject a substantial part of passwords. Users have developed strategies to cope with rejected passwords, but it would be interesting to know the exact factors that contribute to their behavior in these circumstances. Egelman and Peer make a strong argument that there is no ``average user'' so it is necessary to look at individual differences to understand user behavior \cite{Egelman2015AverageUser}. 

% personality traits in cybersecurity are a thing
Demographic background is one of the external factors that influences password selection \cite{Mazurek2013Measuring,  Violettas2014PasswordsAvoidGreece, Wang2015ChinesePWs}. Personality traits have been brought into the discussion to explain user preferences, actions, and behaviors in security questions \cite{Brown2004GeneratingPWs, Gross2016EffectCognitiveEffort, Shropshire2006PersonalityITSec, Zakaria2013DesigningEffectiveSecurityMessages}. Especially in research about phishing susceptibility we find evidence that personality traits have the potential to explain behavior \cite{Halevi2013PilotStudyPersonality,Halevi2015SpearPhishing,ParrishJr2009PersonalityPhishing,Uebelacker2014SocialEngineering}. 
% personality traits even matter for passwords
Empirical results from password studies have been discussed and explained with different personality traits, too \cite{Haque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword,Weirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion}. It is a evident that a user's personality shines through, when they select a word based on personal preferences. 
% characterize personality in this realm
Petrie classified users in distinct password personalities: family-oriented, fans, fantasists, and cryptics\footnote{The original survey is not available online anymore. In a personal inquiry with Ms Petrie, she said that the original data is with the firm who commissioned the survey. The aggregated statistics are available at \url{http://passwordresearch.com/stats/statistic130.html}, \la{29.01.2018}}. A LastPass report more roughly divides password usage into two groups \cite{LastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked}: Type A users want to stay in control and are driven to act securely, so they developed an elaborate system that they perceive as suitable. Type B users do not believe that their accounts are valuable to attackers, so they do not prioritize security over usability. 
% this kind of categorization is nice, but too rough, maybe something more sound would solve the situation.
Those two taxonomies stem from analysis of user-selected passwords, i.e. a retrospective evaluation. However, predictive approaches are under-explored. For instance, if a user is generally an emotional person, does this impact their password selection strategies? If a user is diligent in real life, do they invest effort to diligently craft passwords, too? 
%``I can't remember passwords anyway'' could be attributed to a person who is less conscientious and/or less neurotic. 
%Are neurotic people more concerned about password strength, because they fear attacks more?

% that's what we do.
In a series of user studies we explored the associations between personality traits and passwords. If such associations exist, a new range of support systems opens that are tailored to a user's personality. Current one-fits-all approaches could be re-designed radically. The research was carried out in cooperation with three students. In each separate project we focused on a different stage of the password life-cycle. Timo Erdelt investigated personality as predictor for the usability of composition policies \cite{Erdelt2017BA}. Paul Huber explored correlations between strength perceptions and personality traits \cite{Huber2016BA}. Finally, Aline Neumann examined personality factors in password selection \cite{Neumann2017BA}. In total, 453 individuals participated in three separate online studies. In the following chapter, the projects are put into context and their findings are discussed on a bigger picture. 

\subsubsection*{Research Objectives}
Our primary goal was to find ways to predict password behavior from personality traits. At this point, the discourse about risky passwords included personality factors as explanatory variables. However, only few empirical studies had been carried out to challenge the assumptions. We aimed to provide such empirical data and a discussion of the implications on the design of password policies and password authentication systems. For instance, adjusting requirements of password policies depending on the user's personality promises to reduce frustration of password selection. Thus, our over-arching research question can be framed as ``\textit{Does personality influence user's mental models of password strength and selection strategies?}''.

%Goals/motivation: 
%- some publications tried interpreted their findings as a consequence of different personality traits. first mentioned in \cite{Weirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion} that personality could make a difference -- however, this had never been tried to empirically measure. 
%- explore differences in certain coping strategies (selection and reuse) through the lens of personality
%- find suitable ways to adjust password policies \cite{Seitz2017PersonalizingPasswordPolicies} - when users need to reset their password, after they had used the service for a while.

%We posed the following research questions before we set out to conduct the study.\\
%\textbf{RQ1 - Psychological Factors} How much do psychological factors affect the perceived strength of passwords?\\
%\textbf{RQ2 - Big-Five vs GDMS} Are the Big-Five traits stronger or weaker predictors for strength perception than other psychological variables?\\
%\textbf{RQ3 - Portfolio Factors} Is the personal password portfolio associated with strength perception?

\section{Background and Related Work}
%We position our work in usable security and privacy, in particular password research. Moreover, we include psychological models to better understand users dealing with passwords. 
In this section we give a brief overview about the characteristics of strong passwords and how users go about creating them. Moreover, we portray projects in usable security and privacy research in which the users' psyche has been the focus.

\subsection{Password Selection Preconditions and Context Factors}
%TODO subconscious? 
%not exhaustive
% DEMOGRAPHICS
However, apart from such conscious behavior, there may be other preconditions that make some users pick stronger passwords than others. In a large field study, Mazurek et al. found that computer science and engineering students created passwords that were less guessable than those from business or politics students \cite{Mazurek2013Measuring}. Beyond demographic background, context factors like the emotional state during password selection have also been investigated. 
% EMOTIONS
Gulenko examined the effect of presenting positive textual messages and icons during password selection and found benefits for the adoption of passphrases \cite{Gulenko2014PasswordsEmotion}. In contrast, putting users in a state of cognitive distress or depletion made participants choose weaker passwords in a large lab study \cite{Gross2016EffectCognitiveEffort}. 
% PAST EXPERIENCES / BREACHES / ATTACKS
Social pressure as another type of psychological leverage was investigated by Egelman \etal \cite{Egelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven}. While they argue that account value plays a superior role for the effectiveness of password meters, others have shown that the \textit{design} of a password meter does have a measurable impact on the effort users put into creating a password \cite{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp}. In summary, the literature shows that password selection depends on context factors beyond education and experience. 
\subsection{Personality Factors in Cyber Security}
In our work, we are interested in context factors of password strength originating from psychological variables like personality. One of the most commonly used models to characterize personality are the Big-Five traits (B5), also known as the five-factor model. Costa and McCrae \cite{Costa1992NEO} refer to the personality traits as \textit{openness to experience}, \textit{conscientiousness}, \textit{extraversion}, \textit{agreeableness}, and \textit{neuroticism} (OCEAN). The traits can be described with these exemplary adjectives \cite{McCrae1987ValidationFFM}:\\
\textbf{Openness:} imaginative, creative, curious, independent, liberal\\
\textbf{Conscientiousness:} careful, reliable, ambitious, scrupulous, neat, punctual\\
\textbf{Extraversion:} sociable, talkative, passionate, warm\\
\textbf{Agreeableness:} selfless, helpful, forgiving, cheerful, humble\\
\textbf{Neuroticism:} worrying, emotional, insecure, impatient, vulnerable, subjective

Most frequently, the influence of these personality traits have been explored for privacy-concerns, where the openness trait was associated with privacy attitudes \cite{Egelman2015PredictingAttitudes,Minkus2014PersonalizationPrivacy}. Other inquiries have shown that personality traits like neuroticism \cite{Halevi2013PilotStudyPersonality} or openness \cite{Uebelacker2014SocialEngineering} might be associated with the response to phishing attacks. The likelihood of employees adhering to security policies is potentially influenced by the manifestation of agreeableness and conscientiousness \cite{Shropshire2006PersonalityITSec,Shropshire2015}. These investigations show that personality trait models are a considerable factor in security and privacy. Yet, our understanding of the influence of personality on password perception and consequently password selection is still low. Our work tries to improve our understanding about the origin of the differences in users' judgments of password strength. 
%is linked to these aspects, because passwords protect privacy of users and sensitive data of companies. %However, how password behaviors are formed and how much of the  is explained by psychological factors is still underexplored

\section{Discussion and Implications}
%In this section we interpret the results and hope to shed light on potential explanations for their origins. % and show the implications for password-authentication systems.

%TODO more elaborately discuss the origin of the results.

% Egelman says:
\subsection{Segmenting Users: Password Personality}
Egelman and Peer highlighted the importance of the the question \textit{which psychographic segments should be targeted [in security and privacy mitigations]?} While they focused on their newly developed SeBIS scale and other psychometric constructs, we are able to give new pointers for segmenting users based on their Big-Five traits in conjunction with demographic factors. To approach the segmentation, we can look at the overall influences of personality and demographic factors on different metrics. Table \ref{tab:personality:associations-overview} lists all significant marginal associations from all three studies. 

% Neuroticism
\paragraph{Neuroticism} In study 1, the primary observation was that neuroticism was associated with difficulty to create an emoji password. Neuroticism, was not associated with any perception metric in study 2, but the third study revealed an interesting association between neuroticsm and self-selected passwords. Metrics in the first and third study revolve around password \textit{creation}: It appears to be both \textbf{easier} to find a password expressing emotions for participants scoring high on neuroticism, and their passwords turned out significantly \textbf{longer} in the third study. 
% story: ``I see the benefit of creating stronger passwords, and I don't mind adding something I like to memorize them, so emojis inside passwords might be cool.''
Thus, targeting neuroticism with persuasive interventions during password creation might boost these positive findings. Nudges should thus focus on making emotional state more \textit{salient} and point out benefits of password length to \textit{positively reinforce} this behavior. 

% Openness
\paragraph{Openness} Policies were not associated with openness, but the perception of password strength showed conclusive associations in that passwords were generally judged \textbf{weaker} with higher openness scores. Participants strongly showing the openness trait were also more likely to base their decision on \textbf{password length} rather than the number of digits. In study 3, we observed that coping strategies involving a password manager were \textbf{less likely} to be found with participants with high openness scores. 
% paraphrased story: ``your passwords are weak, mine are stronger, because they are longer and I don't need help remembering them!''
The significant associations, and absence thereof, tell a conclusive story if we look at passphrases and mnemonic phrase-based passwords. Those types of passwords are strong and often not overly complex \cite{Keith2009PassphraseDesign,Kuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic,Shay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple}. Passphrases, for instance, are often memorable. They also easily exceed length requirements. If they consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, and are separated with regular punctuation symbols, there is no need to add digits to meet a three-class requirement. All this can be seen in the study behavior of participants scoring high on openness, despite the absence of associations between openness and the type of created password in study 3.

\subsection{Assessing Personality Traits in Password Studies}
Studying passwords is challenging, because we often lack access to real-world testbeds. Thus, online studies are a reliable go-to method. However, the modification of independent variables in studies could be accompanied by introducing further covariates to explain effects. Only few such factors have been considered beyond demographic information. Psychometrics could be useful to further localize causality. We have shown that they have explanatory value if an omnibus test shows no significant differences. Thus, psychometrics should not be neglected to boost efficacy of security mitigations for different user segments \cite{Egelman2015AverageUser}. 

However, including elaborate psychometric tests in addition to the core of the research question is probably unrealistic. In our studies we used 50 and 21-item constructs. The latter already showed reduced internal consistency. Thus, to keep studies short, prevent participant fatigue, and obtain reliable data, we propose to focus on the openness and neuroticism personality traits only once their influence has been quantified. These can be measured with only a couple of items (between 9 and 20), so they do not take more than five minutes to answer. 

Still, adding even a few more items to a questionnaire might not always be possible due to study constraints like budget or timeliness of data elicitation. There is, however, a promising approach to quickly and inexpensively obtain personality data from study participants' past behavior. It is possible to infer personality facets from social media data, e.g. public interactions on Facebook \cite{Youyou2015Personality}. Youyou et al. found that such metrics can even outperform psychometric questionnaires. Stachl \etal also found conclusive associations between smartphone usage and personality traits \cite{Stachl2017PersonalitySmartphones}. We thus suggest requesting permission to read either smartphone or social network data as part of the study. Crowd-workers in a large-scale study by Bentley and Chen, for instance, showed little concern to install software on smartphones for research purposes \cite{Bentley2015Phonebook}. While we would not go so far as to read all contacts, call and message history, we believe a differentially private approach can replace personality tests. 

\subsection{Design Implication: Suggestions}
% strength suggestions
Addressing personality facets might also become beneficial for real-time feedback during password creation. In the wild, we encounter password meters that estimate the strength of the password and in some cases even provide verbal feedback about what the user can do to improve the password (e.g. \cite{Wheeler2016zxcvbn}). A simple approach is to try to convince the user to pick a stronger password by suggesting a new one or a modified version of the entered password \cite{Forget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion, Seitz2016SuggestionsDecoy, Shay2015SpoonfulOfSugar}. 

Coming back to the finding that personality had a notable effect on how participants \textit{compared} two passwords, we suppose that it plays a role for real-time suggestions, too. How a modified version or newly generated password is received likely depends on the user's personality. For instance, if the user's password is visible in clear text while they enter it, displaying an alternative password resembles the comparison task from our study -- which one is stronger? Strength feedback facilitates answering this question. It seems to be easier for \textit{conscientious} people to assess the strength of their password, if there is a clear list of requirements than can be ``checked off'', to make it superior to the suggested password. 

% coping suggestions.
On the other hand, we found that personality and demographic factors are useful to segment audiences. We found that older participants in our third study were more likely to appreciate if they do not need to memorize passwords. They were more likely to use a password manager, paper notes or reusing passwords to reduce cognitive efforts. Thus, there is a great opportunity to suggest a coping strategy instead of a stronger password. For instance, websites or browsers could extend sign-up forms with a prompt to use a password manager. Pointing out the value of not having to memorize the newly created password could speak to especially older participants and drive adoption rates, if the user journey from sign-up to password-manager set-up is simple enough. Kairos, one of the persuasion principles presented in Section \ref{sec:rw:persuasive_patterns}, more likely possesses a higher nudging power than, e.g. a news article recommending a password manager, because users are experiencing the problem first-hand during account creation. 

\subsection{Design Implications: Target Mitigations}
Results from the first study showed differences in the way participants dealt with password rules. The second study indicated that users the perception of password strength depends on both topology and personality. 

Identity providers like Facebook or Google still rely on password authentication, and currently implement a ``one-fits-all'' policy. However, once users have used the services for a while, those parties already possess a large amount of user information. Consequently, the identity providers could alter the enforced policy for individual users depending on personality trait characteristics inferred from usage patterns. We propose to dynamically adjust the policy, for example when users reset their password. Users with an IT background could be asked to conform to a complex
 and long policy, while users showing stronger signs of neuroticism could be nudged towards including an emoji in their password. Such approaches could support the existing mental models of password strength and reduce user frustration with requirements. Ultimately, this can boost usability or user experience of the service. 
 
 \todo{This argument is later revisited in the ``ideas'' an/or PST section, so maybe cross-reference it.}
 
\subsection{Statistical Models}
Reflecting on the use of GAMs - standardized coefficients must be interpreted with care. Standardizing binary variables is not useful, but for Gender and IT background, we reported beta values because the slope was visible in the plots. In any case, the plots should be considered first, because we then are not miscued by the standardized beta. \todo{tell the reader that this is why we refrained from indicating effect sizes in the table that compares the effects}

\section{Conclusion and Future Work}



\subsection{Contribution Summary}
% CONTRIBUTION STATEMENT:
Our work is one of the first to specifically investigate the relationship between personality traits and password strength, respectively password policies. We contribute evidence for (a) the existence of associations between the openness and consciousness traits and password strength assessment. 
The contributions can help  inform the design of more usable password policies and real-time feedback

\subsubsection{Future Work}
A possible next step is to try and leverage information about personality traits to tailor password feedback to make it more effective. As pointed out by related work, some users overestimate the strength improvement of using digits in passwords \cite{Ur2016PerceptionsPassword}, which we generally confirmed with our study. However, not all participants were equally influenced by digits or different character classes inside passwords. Respecting the personality type in real-time feedback while enforcing policies could make the messages more effective and boost usability at the same time. Beyond password policies, personality traits can inform choice architectures. For example, the Choose-Your-Own-Authentication approach \cite{Forget2015CYOA} can benefit from informed default settings depending on personality trait characteristics. The collection and aggregation of the necessary information could be done on mobile phones \cite{DeMontjoye2013}. We consider this approach promising because it has a good chance to improve the user experience of authentication mechanisms and it is already possible to achieve the goal with off-the-shelf technology.

		\section*{Take Aways}
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
			\item Personality is weakly associated with all the measured dimensions: strength perception, policy preference / usability, and password selection. Most notably openness and neuroticism showed conclusive associationes.
			\item The models for the perception of passphrases achieved the highest fit, suggesting a predictable association between personality and strength perception for this type of password. Comparing two passwords was associated with the conscientiousness traits. Mixed models that use both password features and personality trait scores as covariates are the most feasible approach.
			\item Older users might be the best target group for password support tools, because age was a good predictor of their usage. Suggesting good tools during account creation might lead to higher adoption 
%			\item Segmentation of users
			\item Nudges designed for neuroticism should make emotional state more salient and highlight the benefits of \underline{long} passwords.
