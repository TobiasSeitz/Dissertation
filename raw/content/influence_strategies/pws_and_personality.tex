\chapter[Password Personality]{Understanding Password Selection Through the Lens of Personality Traits}\label{chap:pws_and_personality}

%\section{Introduction}
% general introduction
% show that not *everyone* does the same
% selection is an individual task, not everyone selects passwords in the same way
Although there are certain patterns, password selection is a task that each individual handles in their own way. 
% even perception differs.
We have shown in chapter \ref{chap:pasdjo} that password strength is even subjectively \textit{evaluated} differently depending on certain characteristics. Again, while there was an overall tendency, we were not able to break down the strength ratings by individual differences: was there a special user group who performed better than others in the game? What characterizes this user group? Moreover, our previous chapter shed light on password policies in the wild. In a few notable cases, the rules were challenging and reject a substantial part of passwords. Users have developed strategies to cope with rejected passwords, but it would be interesting to know the exact factors that contribute to their behavior in these circumstances. Egelman and Peer make a strong argument that there is no ``average user'' so it is necessary to look at individual differences to understand user behavior \cite{Egelman2015AverageUser}. 

% personality traits in cybersecurity are a thing
Demographic background is one of the external factors that influences password selection \cite{Mazurek2013Measuring,  Violettas2014PasswordsAvoidGreece, Wang2015ChinesePWs}. Personality traits have been brought into the discussion to explain user preferences, actions, and behaviors in security questions \cite{Brown2004GeneratingPWs, Gross2016EffectCognitiveEffort, Shropshire2006PersonalityITSec, Zakaria2013DesigningEffectiveSecurityMessages}. Especially in research about phishing susceptibility we find evidence that personality traits have the potential to explain behavior \cite{Halevi2013PilotStudyPersonality,Halevi2015SpearPhishing,ParrishJr2009PersonalityPhishing,Uebelacker2014SocialEngineering}. 
% personality traits even matter for passwords
Empirical results from password studies have been discussed and explained with different personality traits, too \cite{Haque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword,Weirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion}. It is a evident that a user's personality shines through, when they select a word based on personal preferences. 
% characterize personality in this realm
Petrie classified users in distinct password personalities: family-oriented, fans, fantasists, and cryptics\footnote{The original survey is not available online anymore. In a personal inquiry with Ms Petrie, she said that the original data is with the firm who commissioned the survey. The aggregated statistics are available at \url{http://passwordresearch.com/stats/statistic130.html}, \la{29.01.2018}}. A LastPass report more roughly divides password usage into two groups \cite{LastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked}: Type A users want to stay in control and are driven to act securely, so they developed an elaborate system that they perceive as suitable. Type B users do not believe that their accounts are valuable to attackers, so they do not prioritize security over usability. 
% this kind of categorization is nice, but too rough, maybe something more sound would solve the situation.
Those two taxonomies stem from analysis of user-selected passwords, i.e. a retrospective evaluation. However, predictive approaches are under-explored. For instance, if a user is generally an emotional person, does this impact their password selection strategies? If a user is diligent in real life, do they invest effort to diligently craft passwords, too? 
%``I can't remember passwords anyway'' could be attributed to a person who is less conscientious and/or less neurotic. 
%Are neurotic people more concerned about password strength, because they fear attacks more?

% that's what we do.
In a series of user studies we explored the associations between personality traits and passwords. If such associations exist, a new range of support systems opens that are tailored to a user's personality. Current one-fits-all approaches could be re-designed radically. The research was carried out in cooperation with three students. In each separate project we focused on a different stage of the password life-cycle. Timo Erdelt investigated personality as predictor for the usability of composition policies \cite{Erdelt2017BA}. Paul Huber explored correlations between strength perceptions and personality traits \cite{Huber2016BA}. Finally, Aline Neumann examined personality factors in password selection \cite{Neumann2017BA}. In total, 453 individuals participated in three separate online studies. In the following chapter, the projects are put into context and their findings are discussed on a bigger picture. 

\subsubsection*{Research Objectives}
Our primary goal was to find ways to predict password behavior from personality traits. At this point, the discourse about risky passwords included personality factors as explanatory variables. However, only few empirical studies had been carried out to challenge the assumptions. We aimed to provide such empirical data and a discussion of the implications on the design of password policies and password authentication systems. For instance, adjusting requirements of password policies depending on the user's personality promises to reduce frustration of password selection. Thus, our over-arching research question can be framed as ``\textit{Does personality influence user's mental models of password strength and selection strategies?}''.

%Goals/motivation: 
%- some publications tried interpreted their findings as a consequence of different personality traits. first mentioned in \cite{Weirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion} that personality could make a difference -- however, this had never been tried to empirically measure. 
%- explore differences in certain coping strategies (selection and reuse) through the lens of personality
%- find suitable ways to adjust password policies \cite{Seitz2017PersonalizingPasswordPolicies} - when users need to reset their password, after they had used the service for a while.

%We posed the following research questions before we set out to conduct the study.\\
%\textbf{RQ1 - Psychological Factors} How much do psychological factors affect the perceived strength of passwords?\\
%\textbf{RQ2 - Big-Five vs GDMS} Are the Big-Five traits stronger or weaker predictors for strength perception than other psychological variables?\\
%\textbf{RQ3 - Portfolio Factors} Is the personal password portfolio associated with strength perception?

\section{Background and Related Work}
%We position our work in usable security and privacy, in particular password research. Moreover, we include psychological models to better understand users dealing with passwords. 
In this section we give a brief overview about the characteristics of strong passwords and how users go about creating them. Moreover, we portray projects in usable security and privacy research in which the users' psyche has been the focus.

%Moreover, since sophisticated attacks often start with checking for already known passwords, obtaining clear text data goes along with attackers improving their approach. A password that was strong before can quickly become very weak.

%\subsection{Studies of Personality in Cyber Security}
\subsection{Password Selection Preconditions and Context Factors}
%TODO subconscious? 
%not exhaustive
% DEMOGRAPHICS
However, apart from such conscious behavior, there may be other preconditions that make some users pick stronger passwords than others. In a large field study, Mazurek et al. found that computer science and engineering students created passwords that were less guessable than those from business or politics students \cite{Mazurek2013Measuring}. Beyond demographic background, context factors like the emotional state during password selection have also been investigated. 
% EMOTIONS
Gulenko examined the effect of presenting positive textual messages and icons during password selection and found benefits for the adoption of passphrases \cite{Gulenko2014PasswordsEmotion}. In contrast, putting users in a state of cognitive distress or depletion made participants choose weaker passwords in a large lab study \cite{Gross2016EffectCognitiveEffort}. 
% PAST EXPERIENCES / BREACHES / ATTACKS
Social pressure as another type of psychological leverage was investigated by Egelman \etal \cite{Egelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven}. While they argue that account value plays a superior role for the effectiveness of password meters, others have shown that the \textit{design} of a password meter does have a measurable impact on the effort users put into creating a password \cite{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp}. In summary, the literature shows that password selection depends on context factors beyond education and experience. 
\subsection{Personality Factors in Cyber Security}
In our work, we are interested in context factors of password strength originating from psychological variables like personality. One of the most commonly used models to characterize personality are the Big-Five traits (B5), also known as the five-factor model. Costa and McCrae \cite{Costa1992NEO} refer to the personality traits as \textit{openness to experience}, \textit{conscientiousness}, \textit{extraversion}, \textit{agreeableness}, and \textit{neuroticism} (OCEAN). The traits can be described with these exemplary adjectives \cite{McCrae1987ValidationFFM}:\\
\textbf{Openness:} imaginative, creative, curious, independent, liberal\\
\textbf{Conscientiousness:} careful, reliable, ambitious, scrupulous, neat, punctual\\
\textbf{Extraversion:} sociable, talkative, passionate, warm\\
\textbf{Agreeableness:} selfless, helpful, forgiving, cheerful, humble\\
\textbf{Neuroticism:} worrying, emotional, insecure, impatient, vulnerable, subjective

Most frequently, the influence of these personality traits have been explored for privacy-concerns, where the openness trait was associated with privacy attitudes \cite{Egelman2015PredictingAttitudes,Minkus2014PersonalizationPrivacy}. Other inquiries have shown that personality traits like neuroticism \cite{Halevi2013PilotStudyPersonality} or openness \cite{Uebelacker2014SocialEngineering} might be associated with the response to phishing attacks. The likelihood of employees adhering to security policies is potentially influenced by the manifestation of agreeableness and conscientiousness \cite{Shropshire2006PersonalityITSec,Shropshire2015}. These investigations show that personality trait models are a considerable factor in security and privacy. Yet, our understanding of the influence of personality on password perception and consequently password selection is still low. Our work tries to improve our understanding about the origin of the differences in users' judgments of password strength. 
%is linked to these aspects, because passwords protect privacy of users and sensitive data of companies. %However, how password behaviors are formed and how much of the  is explained by psychological factors is still underexplored

\section{Discussion of Research Questions}
In this section we interpret the results and hope to shed light on potential explanations for their origins. % and show the implications for password-authentication systems.

%TODO more elaborately discuss the origin of the results.

% quick run thru results:
study 1:
on average: difficulty to create passwords under different policies the same, but digging deeper shows significant differences depending on Neuroticism (emoji12), Gender (female 2word12 and emoji12 more difficult), and at which position the respective policy came (especially for emoji and 3class12). no other effects / explicable findings.

IT background -> emoji policy disliked. if it appeared later in the study, preference also decreased. high neuroticism or agreeableness scores --> put emoji first

time to create: conscientious Ps less time, but the more often the task was carried out the less time people took - learning effects and/or fatigue. 

--> summary: neuroticism and emojis associated. IT background <3 traditional policies. within groups design was a good choice at this stage because we could identify associations with rankings, but learning effects and ordering had significantly influenced people. 

study 2: 
people were able to judge password strength fairly well (as in PASDJO). openness was the most useful trait to explain strength perceptions. LUDS metrics predict subjective strength ratings well which is supported by self-reported rating strategies. However, associations were strongly reversed if digits or symbols acted as l33t substitutions - which we did not read in qualitative statements. The finding also contradicts PASDJO's results, but is limited by the fact that passwords were not randomly generated, so we conclude that it was the particular choice of passwords that generated this result. Respondents were skeptical about this password creation strategy for the two l33t passwords. In general, more digits, uppercase letters and symbols lead to higher ratings. Personality on the other hand was a minor factor in strength \textbf{perception}. This changed when participants had to \textit{compare} passwords -- conscientious participants showed stronger signs of reyling on LUDS characteristics, while open participants voted for the longer password, which helps segment participant groups. 
Interestingly none of the personality influence of these two traits were visible in the password selection study.

study 3:
neuroticism and password length go together. significant but weak correlations here and there but generally poor model fits. 


it background and password strength/length 
older participants more likely to cope with passwords in different ways (PWM, paper, reuse), but not with memorization. its a natural thing - as you get older you will have had more chances to create accounts so the burden increases and you start looking for new ways to deal with it. 

the longer the self-selected passwords the more likely they were forgotten at the end of the survey

%TODO look at the numbers - when were there conclusive associations with personality traits and then draw inferences from the numbers. 


% Egelman says:
% Which psychographic segments should be targeted?
openness, neuroticism the biggest drivers - 

% Which privacy and security mitigations are most likely to benefit from being tailored to individual traits?

% How can knowledge of a user's individual differences be *abused*, and how might this be prevented
as predictive models get better (machine learning instead of statistical approaches) the likelihood of exploiting the information increases

% How can the segmentation be performed automatically without active user involvement?
% 	difficult questions -- smartphones
\subsection{Assessing Personality Traits in Password Studies}
Studying passwords is challenging, because we often lack access to real-world testbeds. Thus, online studies are a reliable go-to method. However, the modification of independent variables in studies could be accompanied by introducing further covariates to explain effects. Only few such factors have been considered beyond demographic information. Psychometrics could be useful to further localize causality. We have shown that they have explanatory value if an omnibus test shows no significant differences. Thus, psychometrics should not be neglected to boost efficacy of security mitigations for different user segments \cite{Egelman2015AverageUser}. 

However, including elaborate psychometric tests in addition to the core of the research question is probably unrealistic. In our studies we used 50 and 21-item constructs. The latter already showed reduced internal consistency. Thus, to keep studies short, prevent participant fatigue, and obtain reliable data, we propose to focus on the openness and neuroticism personality traits only once their influence has been quantified. These can be measured with only a couple of items (between 9 and 20), so they do not take more than five minutes to answer. 

Still, adding even a few more items to a questionnaire might not always be possible due to study constraints like budget or timeliness of data elicitation. There is, however, a promising approach to quickly and inexpensively obtain personality data from study participants' past behavior. It is possible to infer personality facets from social media data, e.g. public interactions on Facebook \cite{Youyou2015Personality}. Youyou et al. found that such metrics can even outperform psychometric questionnaires. Stachl \etal also found conclusive associations between smartphone usage and personality traits \cite{Stachl2017PersonalitySmartphones}. We thus suggest requesting permission to read either smartphone or social network data as part of the study. Crowd-workers in a large-scale study by Bentley and Chen, for instance, showed little concern to install software on smartphones for research purposes \cite{Bentley2015Phonebook}. While we would not go so far as to read all contacts, call and message history, we believe a differentially private approach can replace personality tests. 



\section{Conclusion and Future Work}


\subsection{Contribution Summary}
% CONTRIBUTION STATEMENT:
Our work is one of the first to specifically investigate the relationship between personality traits and password strength, respectively password policies. We contribute evidence for (a) the existence of associations between the openness and consciousness traits and password strength assessment. 
The contributions can help  inform the design of more usable password policies and real-time feedback

\subsubsection{Future Work}
A possible next step is to try and leverage information about personality traits to tailor password feedback to make it more effective. As pointed out by related work, some users overestimate the strength improvement of using digits in passwords \cite{Ur2016PerceptionsPassword}, which we generally confirmed with our study. However, not all participants were equally influenced by digits or different character classes inside passwords. Respecting the personality type in real-time feedback while enforcing policies could make the messages more effective and boost usability at the same time. Beyond password policies, personality traits can inform choice architectures. For example, the Choose-Your-Own-Authentication approach \cite{Forget2015CYOA} can benefit from informed default settings depending on personality trait characteristics. The collection and aggregation of the necessary information could be done on mobile phones \cite{DeMontjoye2013}. We consider this approach promising because it has a good chance to improve the user experience of authentication mechanisms and it is already possible to achieve the goal with off-the-shelf technology.

		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
			\item Personality is weakly associated with all the measured dimensions: strength perception, policy preference / usability, and password selection. 
			\item The models for the perception of passphrases achieved the highest fit, suggesting a predictable association between personality and strength perception for this type of password. Comparing two passwords was associated with the conscientiousness traits. Mixed models that use both password features and personality trait scores as covariates are the most feasible approach.
