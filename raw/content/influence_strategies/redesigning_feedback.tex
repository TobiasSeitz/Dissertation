\chapter[Redesigning Verbal and Non-Verbal Password Feedback]{Redesigning Verbal and Non-Verbal Password Feedback}\label{chap:redesigning_feedback}


%TODO Result summary. 
\section{Background and Context}

\subsection{Research Questions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[RQ1] Which other feedback solutions are feasible to influence password selection?
	\item[RQ2] What are the benefits of verbal and non-verbal feedback?
	\item[RQ3] Does feedforward work better than feedback?
	\item[RQ4] 
\end{itemize}

\section{Related Work}
mention work here that hadn't been addressed before, but this might go.

\section{Case Study: Work Passwords}
\todo{BA von Caroline Olsienkewicz}

\subsection{Samples}
mention screening procedure
\subsection{Results}

\subsubsection{Feedback needs to be Personalized}
not all feedback worked for everyone, and people wanted to know how they can improve their own password, and not just a random strategy

tension: personalization comes at the price of being more vulnerable
\subsubsection{Visual feedback first, verbal feedback next}
Participants preferred visual feedback, and it's less judgy but to make sure, add verbal feedback. This is a similar conclusion to \cite{Ur2017DataDrivenPWMeter} (which came later than our work but roughly at the same time. So we chose a timely topic.)

\subsubsection{Verbal feedback requires more verbal feedback}
Once you start giving feedback (``strong'' or ``weak'') you need to explain how you came to this conclusion. The explanation often leads to more explanations, and there's an endless number of aspects that you could discuss (see this thesis), but that's unfeasible. 


\subsubsection{Nudging by Examples most promising}
show passwords --> corroborates findings from decoy study --> story line could arch over to decoy and use it as motivation (suggesting passwords). 


\subsection{Limitations}
self report (work password) 

inconsistencies (removed if too weird))
