% lingo: Narrative.

% FOCUS: Involve users in finding ways to provide better/more helpful/more actionable feedback. 
% learn from what they say explicitly, but also explicitly. 
% underlying persuasive principle: \textit{social interaction} (team spirit) between the system and the users. (Forget et al).
% weirich and sasse / Sasse and Felchais --> Socio-Technical System. 
% participatory design methods, open questions, learning from feature requests.
% opportunity: past studies focused on retrospection. We involve users in creating new solutions without a basic starting point. 

% theoretically, magdalena's BA topic could be worth mentioning, too. 
% GOALs.
% 	Design nudges without letting users become aware of that. 
% 	Evaluate 

Goals: Help users create passwords that they can handle without a PWM (see previous chapter \ref{chap:mm_pwm}),
RQs: how can we leverage persuasive design strategies for that? Are PW meters the right (and only) way?
Method: \textbf{Design research about requirements and ``other ways'' to help users through improved feedback}.
Practical Issues: see section on running password studies
Ethical issues: collect plain text passwords? tried in bandwagon study, but there's some resentment. 


Storyline:

%(Intro: 1-2 pages)
Problems:
- nudging approaches have become stale
- some solutions don't focus on the core goals like stronger passwords and/or less reuse
- we found no formal requirement elicitation in 


Goals:
- what do users say they need? derive solutions and design lenses from that. 
- explore solutions that go beyond password meters. (THATS AN OVERALL GOAL)
- put the users first and early (very user-centric)
- learn from their design solutions (co-design) to inform future design decisions.

what this chapter can realistically achieve: 
verbal feedback: what is required. qualitative stuff (hint at suggestion trustworthiness, personalization)
nudging: both verbally and visually; dimension: cognitive bias (bandwagon)

\begin{itemize}
	\item[RQ1] Which other feedback solutions/modalities are most feasible to influence password selection?
	\item[RQ2] What are the pros and cons of verbal and non-verbal feedback?
	\item[RQ3] Does feed-\textit{forward} work better than feedback?
\end{itemize}

This chapter reports on a requirements- and design-exploration for password feedback, where we aimed to involve users early in the design process. The project was a collaboration between myself and Caroline Olsienkiewicz, respectively Katharina Schwarz.

\section{Discussion}


\subsection{Requirements}

The feedback needs to...

% in the form of user stories
The user needs to...
% ... sort of a mantra.

-- things ``wear off'' over time --> habituation effects of password feedback --> surprise is an important element. 

\subsection{Current Frameworks and Feedback Systems}
How do the requirements reflect the persuasive authentication framework?

Do password meters and other solutions fulfill the requirements?
Where is potential to improve?

\subsection{Learnings}

- how did this approach help us now?
- what did we learn?
- why should we look elsewhere?
- put solutions / needs into SEHE grid.

\section{Conclusion}
The overarching themes in Study 1 are interestingly just what makes a \textbf{good teacher}: show how it's done and the consequences of actions, explain background info in more depth (which is filtered out anyhow), help students achieve what the teacher showed, and empower them by giving new possibilities to apply knowledge. So this superbly reflects Weirich and Sasse's AND Forget \etal's notion that persuasion is a tool to \textit{educate and teach}. Where is the nudging part?

--> both verbal and visual feedback need to be combined
the requirements should somehow be related to what's to come in the decoy chapter. E.g. the suggestive and 

trustworthiness of suggestions / feedback was challenged by first participants.


all in all, participants in the survey were somewhat too optimistic compared to quantitative / empirical results.

The way people designed interventions shows their mental models and lets us inform our own design decisions. We are not the users and simply ``knowing it better'' won't get us very far. We have to pick people up where they are to have a chance in designing effective nudges. 

--> empowerment... TODO.

hard to explain problem space / pw strength to users so briefly. tension. when and for whom.

		\section*{Take Aways}
		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
			\item General requirement elicitation showed that users want to have their mental models confirmed with password feedback. They become skeptical if the feedback shows unexpected strength results.
			\item Users have three essential needs regarding password support and feedback systems: \textbf{Show} the behavior and consequences visually, \textit{Explain} things that break mental models, \textbf{Help} resolve conundrums and achieve better behavior. %Sounds trivial, but it's important we confirmed it%

%Kicked out: (Third Step: Hard to justify co-creation):
%\section{Case Study: Jumping on the Bandwagon}
%focus: design rationale and short qualitative evaluation. 
%aim: gauge general feasibility, quantify effects on small scale. 
%\todo{MA von Saron Mebratu}
%Mention that LastPass already has something like this now. -- find out when they introduced it (write them an email) 
%--> nudging via bias seems interesting, but bandwagon is countered with reactance.
