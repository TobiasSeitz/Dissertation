The overall goal of this thesis is to support users in how they interact with passwords. As a sub-goal, we wanted to help those users who want to handle password management on their own, i.e. without a password manager. We set out to achieve this goal by studying the design space of password feedback mechanisms like password meters. There have been many design proposals already and numerous evaluations. However, the design-space appears rather narrow if we only look at existing solutions, and many have not achieved the envisioned level of support. Therefore, we posit that the design-space needs to be opened up and show more width. To get there, looking at the requirements of password feedback is a necessary first step. Previous solutions have seldom reported a structured requirement elicitation based on user research. Thus, before designing and implementing support strategies outside of the usual spectrum we aimed to first understand the needs and expectations that users may have about password feedback. We tried to learn from their feature requests and their own proposals to be able to inform future design decisions. In particular, we posed the following broad research questions:

\begin{itemize}
	\item[RQ1] What do users \textit{expect} from password support tools during account creation (explicit) and what do they really \textit{need} (implicit)?
	\item[RQ2] How can we design password feedback in novel ways outside of the visual password meter and verbal real-time feedback spectrum? % Which alternative feedback solutions might be feasible to influence password selection? What individual roles do verbal and non-verbal feedback play?
	\item[RQ3] How can we leverage the interplay between feed-\textit{forward} and feedback?
\end{itemize}

%Goals: Help users create passwords that they can handle without a PWM (see previous chapter \ref{chap:mm_pwm}),
%RQs: how can we leverage persuasive design strategies for that? Are PW meters the right (and only) way?
%Method: \textbf{Design research about requirements and ``other ways'' to help users through improved feedback}.
%Practical Issues: see section on running password studies
%Ethical issues: collect plain text passwords? tried in bandwagon study, but there's some resentment.

%%(Intro: 1-2 pages)
%Problems:
%- nudging approaches have become stale
%- some solutions don't focus on the core goals like stronger passwords and/or less reuse
%- we found no formal requirement elicitation in the literature.
%
%Goals:
%- what do users say they need? derive solutions and design lenses from that. 
%- explore solutions that go beyond password meters. (THATS AN OVERALL GOAL)
%- put the users first and early (very user-centric)
%- learn from their design solutions (co-design) to inform future design decisions.

%nudging: both verbally and visually; dimension: cognitive bias (bandwagon)

This chapter reports on a requirements- and design-exploration for password feedback, where we aimed to involve users early in the design process. The project was a collaboration between myself and Caroline Olsienkiewicz, respectively Katharina Schwarz.

\section{Discussion}
The insights from two rapid methods allow us to derive requirements for persuasive password support, which we put into the context of existing frameworks. 

\subsection{Requirements}
Although the first study was focused on explicit and observable needs, qualitative analysis even brought about more profound needs. Similarly, the second study also helped us understand explicit user needs. Therefore, it was hard to classify the needs, because they were very nuanced. Nonetheless, we show the central characteristics of the requirements in Table \ref{tab:co-design:requirements}.

\paragraph{Opportunities} Password meters and real-time feedback are the de facto paragon of persuasion in the wild.  Most commonly, they fulfill requirements (1), (2), (4), and (5). For instance, Google's password meter visually encodes password strength with color and bar-size, suggests not using a pet's name, offers extensive background information with a clear call-to-action, and does not jeopardize trustworthiness with extravagant design. On the other hand, it does not necessarily empower users to break habits, is not personalized (what if the user does not have a pet?), and does not account for other ``obvious'' strategies. Academia has produced alternative designs that fulfill requirements (7), (8), and (9), although unusual concepts (like in \cite{Ur2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp}) were rarely adopted in practice. Empowerment, personalization, and breaking habituation effects have been underexplored, and thus might be worthwhile opportunities for future studies.

\subsection{Relation to Current Frameworks}
Most of the themes and requirements show strong links to various persuasion frameworks. In the first study, the qualitative analysis resulted in four essential themes: show, explain, help, empower. Interestingly, there are parallels to \textbf{teaching}. Teachers \textit{show} something new, and then \textit{explain} it in more detail. They \textit{help} students understand it. Often students can then exercise and explore ways to apply their knowledge, i.e. the process \textit{empowers} students to achieve something they could not do before. Forget \etal, who contributed one of the early works on persuasion in cybersecurity, promoted their \acrlong{PAF} as a tool to \textbf{educate} users. All the elements of our qualitative analysis are thus visible in their framework. The requirements in Table \ref{tab:co-design:requirements} represent the themes on a more fine-grained level. Only requirements (8) and (10) are hard to put into the PAF, hence they extend the framework.  
Requirement (8) states that a password support tool should be noticeable and foster curiosity. Generating curiosity can be done in numerous ways, but in this context it relates to Cialdini's \textit{scarcity} principle. The number of ``good'' passwords is much smaller than the number of ``bad'' ones, thus they are a scarce resource. The requirement states that users should realize this and become motivated to access the limited resource. %At the same, time it needs to be easy enough (requirement (7)) and users need to be capable to achieve the goal, which reflects 
%TODO streamline, try to find sub-headings to identify weak structure.

\section{Conclusion}
% goal: understand and externalize the requirements / design space of persuasive interventions
Our goal was to understand the requirements of persuasive password support, especially user needs and expectations. 
% triangulation of methods was feasible and let us derive such requirements
We triangulated methods to rapidly derive feasible requirement that guide future designs of interventions. 
% while survey exhibited explicit idealistic needs, the participatory approach was much more suitable to identify latent needs.
The survey yielded explicit and idealistic needs, like having one's own mental model confirmed by the feedback system. On the other hand, the participatory approach of the second study helped us identify latent needs that would not be detectable in a survey. The results, however, fit together well and solidify the overarching themes ``show'', ``explain'', ``help'', ``empower''. 
% requirements indicate that only verbal or only visual nudging methods are insufficient, they need to be combined
% ur etal recently confirmed this.
Here, we found that participants' expectations of password feedback were nuanced and can thus only be met by combining both verbal and visual support. Feedback was not the only component, because participants showed a need for more guidance in the form of feed\textit{forward}.
% most of the requirements and needs were more or less predictable and already visible in other frameworks, but this specific list helps shaping future desing ideas
The requirements might have been partially predictable even without conducting user research, but tacit and latent needs are uncommonly discussed in related research. Especially the thinking processes and participants' design approaches in the participatory sessions revealed much of what they envisioned in a successful intervention.
% large opportunitites in personalization, empowerment, and breaking habituation. 
Applying the requirements to gauge existing solutions, we identified opportunities for future work in personalization, empowerment, and preventing habituation effects from the same kind of intervention. These are addressed in the following chapters.

		\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
			\item Triangulation of study methods helped us identify different levels of user needs. Especially the tacit and latent needs are harder to elicit, but participatory design methods were feasible to enhance survey data.
			\item As an explicit need, participants wanted to have their mental models confirmed with password feedback. They become skeptical if the feedback shows unexpected strength results.
			\item Password support systems should meet four essential user needs: \textbf{Show} the current behavior and its consequences visually, \textbf{explain} things that contradict usual mental models, \textbf{help} resolve such dissonances and \textbf{empower} users to act differently.

%\todo{MA von Saron Mebratu}
%Mention that LastPass already has something like this now. -- find out when they introduced it (write them an email) 
%--> nudging via bias seems interesting, but bandwagon is countered with reactance.

%The overarching themes in Study 1 are interestingly just what makes a \textbf{good teacher}: show how it's done and the consequences of actions, explain background info in more depth (which is filtered out anyhow), help students achieve what the teacher showed, and empower them by giving new possibilities to apply knowledge. So this superbly reflects Weirich and Sasse's AND Forget \etal's notion that persuasion is a tool to \textit{educate and teach}. 
%Even in study 2, the final concept is based on a constructivistic teaching paradigm: self-guided exploration and curiosity.

%\subsection{Learnings}
%
%- how did this approach help us now?
%- what did we learn?
%- why should we look elsewhere?
%- put solutions / needs into SEHE grid.

%all in all, participants in the survey were somewhat too optimistic compared to quantitative / empirical results.

%the requirements should somehow be related to what's to come in the decoy chapter. E.g. the suggestive and trustworthiness of suggestions / feedback was challenged by first participants.

%The way people designed interventions shows their mental models and lets us inform our own design decisions. We are not the users and simply ``knowing it better'' won't get us very far. We have to pick people up where they are to have a chance in designing effective nudges. 

%--> empowerment... TODO.
%hard to explain problem space / pw strength to users so briefly. tension. when and for whom. 


% why isn't this trivial?
% where is the nudging part?
