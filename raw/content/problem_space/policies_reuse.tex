\section{Background and Context}

	It would be nice to have an easy way to create a repository with all password policies, but it isn't easy - at least it helps to agree on a standard language to define a password policy \cite{Steves2015PasswordPolicyLanguage}

It would be good to have a formal description of password policies in a standardized schema \cite{Horsch2016PasswordPolicyMarkup}
