There are several cues that the studies conducted by Herley, FlorÃªncio, Sasse and others (e.g. \cite{Florencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits}) may not be representative for the amount of authentication tasks users face today. 

On the one hand, the number of web services on the web has grown. One could expect that this means users have the chance to sign up to new services more often and that their portfolio of accounts continually grows.
