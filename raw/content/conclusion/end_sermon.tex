Key thoughts

\begin{itemize}
\item Passwords are bad. Let's hope passwords vanish at some point. Make machines intelligent enough to decide if a user should be granted access or not. But this brings new problems.
\item Maybe passwords are the vinyl records of usable security - everyone agrees that it's kind of an obsolete technology but there's something to it that ensure they don't disappear. %TODO come up with a better analogy.
 \item  if passwords become obsolete tomorrow, many of us will not grief. 
 \item  the media should stop shaming the users 
 
\end{itemize}


%TODO I have more thann 100 ``takeaways'' from papers. This could be a funny ``sermon'' too (Luther's 100 theses);
