``but his thoughts were so full of the great riches he should possess, that he could not think of the word to make it open, but instead of `Sesame,' said, `Open, Barley!' and was much amazed to find that the door remained fast shut. He named several sorts of grain, but still the door would not open, and the more he endeavoured to remember the word `Simsim,' the more his memory was confounded, and he had as much forgotten it as if he had never heard it mentioned.'' (Kasim's predicament in \textit{Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves}) \todo{this could be the opening of the chapter / fancychapter}

Morris and Thompson were already concerned with user behavior regarding passwords in 1979 \cite{Morris1979PasswordSecurity}. They identified that users choose predictable passwords and that this can be leveraged for attacks. So, they suggested enforcing a certain minimum password length (six characters). At the time, the users were mostly professionals that received training to operate computers and could thus also have been trained to pick less predictable passwords \cite{Maguire2012YouOnlyLiveTwice}. But as computers were introduced to a larger audience, more people were exposed to password authentication. Naturally, this also induced a growing number of attacks, and it is increasingly difficult for users to defend themselves against them (see. Section \ref{sec:rw:attack_vectors}). Nowadays, password policies are in place that require not only a minimum of eight characters, but also mandate mixed-case letters, digits and special symbols to start with. The HCI community noticed the users' struggle in the 1990s and that we can -- and should -- design authentication systems with usability in mind. Perhaps, one of the breaking points where a new school of thought turned up in the literature was a paper by Adams and Sasse in 1999 \cite{Adams1999UsersEnemy}. The central and novel theme in there was a shift from \textit{fixing} the user to \textit{acknowledging} user behavior and designing for it. The paper managed to see over 1500 citations as of writing this.

This chapter looks at the literature that mostly came after this seminal work. It discusses the users' problems, solutions, feelings, and opinions about using passwords. An essential goal is to give the reader an empathetic perspective and provide background information to understand why it seems hard to come up with viable solutions to make users' lives less frustrating. To get there, we first take a brief look at conducting user research with passwords. Hereafter we disseminate typical coping strategies and solutions. The chapter concludes with a comment on the discourse that has been going on between the very different schools of thought about passwords. 

%Each person who gets in contact with the Internet will at some point create a password.

% Everyone develops their own strategy how to do this and how to cope with passwords, probably already in early teenage years \cite{VonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest}. These strategies however are not unique and show macroscopic commonalities, which became evident after the first large-scale password leaks. 

%Important: Under coping strategy, we also understand the selection process, because choosing a weak password over a strong one is also one way to \textit{cope} with the large number of passwords and the memorability burden. (make sure to mention this in the general introduction already.)

\section{Methodology: Running Password Studies}

general overview a la. how to run a good password study 

\cite{Krol2016ExperimentDesign,Peer2017,Consolvo2003,Ross2010,Sotirakopoulos2011,Oppenheimer2009InstructionalManipulationChecks,Harbach2016HardLockLife,Barbera2013,Carreras2013,Chamberlain2012ResearchInTheWild,Henze2013EmpiricalResearchUbiquitous,Kuhn1993,VonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest,Hassenzahl2003,Mazurek2013Measuring,Egelman2015a,Rosoff2014,Savage2012}


Methods:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analyzing leaked data \cite{Veras2012VisualizingSemanticsPasswords}
	\item Lab study \cite{Sotirakopoulos2011}
	\item Field study only with Logging \cite{Florencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits}
	\item Field study with an interactive prototype, often in conjunction with a survey / Diary 
	\item café study  \cite{VonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest}
	\item Mechanical Turk / CrowdSourced 
	\item diary study, e.g. \cite{Hayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs}
	\item Triangulation (survey, log analysis) \cite{Wash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices}
\end{itemize}

all but the first allow controlled selection of passwords

Example: 
Flor\^{e}ncio and Herley probably conducted the largest study to date on password habits. Their intention was to find out among other things A) how often people type passwords, B) how many sites share a password C) how many distinct passwords a user has, and D) how the strong the passwords are. They utilized the Windows Live Toolbar for Internet Explorer to collect in-the-wild data from up to 500000 users during three months of running the collection

\cite{Florencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits}. The established protected password lists (PPL) to avoid intruding into people's privacy. They found that users had about 7 distinct passwords in 2007, and that passwords are re-used at about 6 sites in average. Interestingly, they found that stronger passwords are not re-used as often as weak passwords (only around 4 sites). It was not possible to trace the incoming data back to a specific user, which might have resulted in over counting of entries. Also, it was not measured how long the actual password entries takes. If users only used regular dictionary words without any modification, the key logging module of the toolbar would record a password reuse event (PRE) every time the user entered the word -- also in regular text searches, for example. Another limitation could be that they used entropy as a proxy for password strength. However, as discussed in the previous chapter, we have seen that this metric is more robust for system-generated passwords and that strength estimation has evolved over the past ten years.

	\subsection{Ecological Validity}
		
 as we have seen before, the approaches differ especially in the way ecological validity is achieved.
 
 ``Ideally, password studies would be conducted by collecting data on real passwords created by real users of a deployed system.'' \cite{Komanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople}
 
 explain why ecological validity is super important in this context.
 
 most important papers: 
 many people behave normally, and if you ask them in the survey if they did, this can improve the quality of the data drastically \cite{Fahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy}
 
 \cite{Krol2016ExperimentDesign}
	
	
	There's a Scale that we can use to cheaply measure security intentions so we can better weight study data from individuals \cite{Egelman2015SeBIS}
	SeBIS is a useful tool and looks robust, but it might need more time to really be considered highly valid \cite{Egelman2016BehaviorEverFollows}

	\subsection{Ethics}
	look into ``Critical'' folder on mendeley
	
	issues:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item collecting plain text passwords - people sometimes
		\item finding efficient ways to attack passwords - this might also help attackers. 
		\item sometimes researchers ``phish'' participants to obtain their passwords (\cite{Egelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven, Haque2014Hierarchy, Mazurek2013Measuring}) -- to conceal the study purpose and get ecologically valid passwords.

\section{User Behavior Regarding Passwords}\label{sec:rw:how-users-cope}


\todo{add a table that has all problems on one side and the possible user coping strategies on the other side.}

Take human factors into account when you design secure systems \cite{Sasse2005UsableSecurityPosition}

\cite{Adams1999UsersEnemy} is considered the mother of all HCI \& USEC papers. -- but there were many others before that.

``The main weakness in any password system is that users often choose easily guessable passwords: English words, names, trivial extensions to English words, etc., because they are easy to remember'' from \cite{Feldmeier1990UnixPasswordSecurity},

also 


``password overload'' and ``memory interference'' as technical terms must appear here (for discussion see \cite{Yang2016MnemonicSentenceBased}).


password mechanisms and their users are a socio-technical system and the social aspect weighs heavy \cite{Weirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion}

Security is too hard for end-users and we need to make it more usable. (fair enough it was the early days of USEC) \cite{Dourish2004UserStrategiesEveryday}

\subsection{Selecting Weak Passwords}

	pass\textit{word} implies it has to be a word. Other names for the concept, but basically the same meaning: security code, passcode, secret, credentials, access token
	
	\cite{Jakobsson2013BenefitsUnderstandingPWs}
	
	People show predictable modification behavior \cite{Gaw2005ReuseRecycle}
	
	
	a lot of RockYou's passwords are based on dates and this can be visualized and used for attacks \cite{Veras2012VisualizingSemanticsPasswords}
	
	Greek users do not behave differently than the rest, but the top 100 passwords are a bit different \cite{Violettas2014PasswordsAvoidGreece}

	\subsubsection{Why do Users Select Weak Passwords?}
	
	Users act insecurely because they choose weak passwords that they reuse \cite{Riley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo}
	
	people don't take password policies at organizations seriously.  \cite{Weirich2005PersuasivePasswordSecurity}
	
	- policies allow it (\cite{Seitz2017PoliciesReuse})
	- wrong mental model or misinterpretation of security advice (\cite{Ur2015PWCreationLab, Ur2016PerceptionsPassword, Seitz2017PASDJO})
	- because they don't care
	- ... they underestimate the threat
	- ... they are right to judge the account as low value (who would hack me?) \cite{LastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked}
	
	Passphrases are super predictable because most people use common phrases \cite{Bonneau2012LinguisticProperties}
	
	
	qualitative studies \cite{Ur2015PWCreationLab, Stobert2014PasswordLifeCycle} 
	quantitative studies \cite{Ur2016PerceptionsPassword, Seitz2017PASDJO}
	
	
	Text entry under lab conditions for multiple password selection tasks in a row doesn't have a large effect on typical password metrics \cite{Yang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity}
	
	input modality can be a strong influence on password selection in that mobile devices will lead to less diverse passwords \cite{VonZezschwitz2014HoneyIShrunkTheKeys}
	
	Users understand quite a bit about password security, but we should help them how attacks work \cite{Ur2016PerceptionsPassword}
	
	
	Users are not too bad at creating strong passwords, but often they misinterpret security advice which leads to weak password practices \cite{Ur2015PWCreationLab}
	
	\subsubsection{What's the Problem with Weak Passwords?}
	usually, people tend to use stronger PWs for important accounts
	
	Stronger passwords are not always necessary, do not force users to waste effort. \cite{Florencio2007DoStrongWebPasswords}	


	\subsection{Password Reuse}
	too many accounts problem.
	
	People reuse their passwords and show predictable modification behavior \cite{Gaw2005ReuseRecycle}
	
	The burden of passwords was relatively high in 2007, people reuse passwords \cite{Florencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits}
	
	finite effort, and the payoff is invisible (comparison to smoking: I won't be affected, and in many cases that's true. But if you are affected you regret your behavior. )
	
	reuse is the most convenient way but probably the most severe threat to one's online identity and finances. This is a hard problem. 
	
	it's not just the passwords, it's also the user name 
	
	frequently entered passwords are reused more often \cite{Wash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices} -- but there are contradictory results on this matter. -- Stobert and Biddle argue in the other direction \cite{Stobert2014PasswordLifeCycle}. 
	
	reuse statistic overview of different papers: \cite{Wash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices} in the discussion section. 
	
	term that you read ever so often: users have a ``go-to password'' that they try first
	and then often the policy can make them change another one. But! If the go-to password is strong and has certain characteristics (as is demonstrated in chapter \ref{chap:policies-reuse}), reusing this is possible and its threats perhaps underestimated. 
	
	\textbf{What's the problem?}
	consequences: phishing attacks are problematic because of the domino effect (Ives \etal) Password reuse is difficult to defend against and we should look into understanding user behavior better \cite{Ives2004DominoEffectReuse}.
	
	but reuse isn't bad per se, it's necessary \cite{Florencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser, ZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules}. 
	
		
	Users try to prioritize stronger passwords as reuse candidates, and this also means that users try to follow security advice (they belief strong passwords are more important than unique passwords) \cite{Wash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices}.
	
	
	It's enough to know one low-value password that you mangle to crack a large part of high-value passwords \cite{Haque2014Hierarchy}
	
	
	\subsubsection{Reuse Strategies}
	address the role of policies (see \cite{Seitz2017PoliciesReuse}).
	
	Participants rely on their memory, but reuse passwords, and they have a suboptimal mental model of how attacks work \cite{Gaw2006PasswordManagement}
	
	Users don't care if an account is financial or not, as long as it's perceived as high value, they reuse the password for that \cite{Bailey2014StatisticsReuse}
	
	password reuse is common and modifications are predictable, so it's easy for attackers to optimize their attacks with knowledge from leaked credentials of a specific account \cite{Das2014TangledWeb}

	Password Categories -- arch over to mental accounting from behavioral economics -- \cite{Thaler2004}
	
	Experts have certain articulate strategies to select and manage their passwords, and their situation awareness lets them judge important and non-important accounts more consistently  	\cite{Stobert2015ExpertPassword} 

	Categorization: 
	compare password categorization to mental accounting, then we can cite \cite{Stockinger2015TowardsBE}
	
	category: depending on policies. \cite{Stobert2014PasswordLifeCycle}
	
	
	Coping with passwords by choosing weak passwords and reusing them is absolutely necessary, the problem is how to do it right \cite{Florencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser}.
	
	
	A new scale and insights into password support. Password hierarchy \cite{Haque2015PhdProposal}
	
	\subsection{Tools (Writing Down)}
	\cite{Herley2012PersistenceOfPasswords} is in favor of writing down IF the location is secure enough.
	
	Users struggle to manage passwords, but are unfamiliar with supporting tools, so they have developed elaborate strategies to cope \cite{Stobert2014Agony}
	
		\subsubsection{Problem: Accessibility for Local Attackers}
Word documents post-its (use a screen shot of french newspaper that was featured on tv and you could see one of their passwords in the back. spouses can access them .	


	\subsection{Fallback Methods}
	Click on ``forgot'' password basically every time - to avoid this, some services mainly rely on one time passwords, because users are going to forget theirs anyway. 


	\subsection{Account Sharing}
	Account sharing is very common and often necessary, while current designs do not take this behavior into account \cite{Singh2007PasswordSharing}


\section{The Role of Mobile Devices}

\section{Countermeasures}

if we must keep the human in the loop, e.g. because constraints dictate so, we need to support them well and carefully \cite{Cranor2008FrameworkReasoning}

Usable security shouldn't only be done for end users but also for the people who implement security systems \cite{Acar2016NotYourDeveloper}


	\subsection{Password Composition Policies}
	
	the idea of policies dates back to the 70s: Morris and Thompson suggested to make users
	either choose longer passwords or assign passwords to them \cite{Morris1979PasswordSecurity}
	
	%Lingo: Adhere to a policy
	
	
	Weir \etal categorize policies into ``explicit'' and ``implicit'' policies \cite{Weir2010MetricsPolicies}, where explicit policies have predefined rules about the password structure (e.g. LUDS policy). Implicit policies are based on the estimated strength and are somewhat more volatile and intransparent to the users. Example: blacklist only becomes visible once the user tries to pick a password that's contained in the list. There are also ``external'' policies where the user's password is automatically changed by the system to add some randomness
	
	
	LUDS as a key term \cite{Wheeler2016zxcvbn}
	
		
	Range of Policies as shown by Shay \cite{Shay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable}
	definitely mention: 28.0\% of passwords in comp8 fulfilled the symbol requirement only by placing ``!'' at the end and using no other symbols. 
	
	\cite{ZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules}
	
	
	Workplace-focused: 
	a postulation that password policies should be based on HCI principles rather than security considerations alone. The idea of a holistic password policy is put forward \cite{Inglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies} 
	and \cite{Zakaria2013DesigningEffectiveSecurityMessages}
	
	Don't try to fix the user, fix the system first, especially do not impose strict requirements and nonsensical policies \cite{Florencio2014AdministratorsGuide} 
	
	\cite{Ur2015PWCreationLab}
	
	\cite{Shay2010EncounteringPasswordRequirements}
	
	Most detailed insights into effects of password policy design we have to date, password substring blacklist suggestion \cite{Shay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies}

	basic16, 3class12, and 2word16 seem like the winners in terms of security and usability, but persuasion can help to diversify the themes for word-based passwords \cite{Shay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable}

	\subsection{Advice and Guidelines}
	
	there is a plethora of advice and guidelines out there, but it's not all the same \footurl{https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/helping-end-users-manage-their-passwords}{22.12.2017}
	
	education in password matters only has so much effect. 
	\cite{Forget2007HelpingUsers} says that even instructions don't work
	
	There's some work that argues that users want to create stronger passwords at least for some accounts, but they had
	misinterpreted security advice. 
	this is also reflected in \cite{Ur2016PerceptionsPassword}
	
	Great overview and critical discussion: \cite{ZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules}
	
	
	make it persuasive \cite{Zakaria2013DesigningEffectiveSecurityMessages}
	
	In privacy: people's mental models about privacy are vague and we can see it in their drawings/explanations that they're somewhat overly pessimistic and that education plays the major role \cite{Kang2015MentalModelsDrawing}
	
	
	Stay realistic about password requirements and user effort \cite{Florencio2016CommACM}
		
	
	\subsection{Offering Memorization Techniques}
	
	
	early approaches: random but pronounceable passwords. (good overview in \cite{Kuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic})
	
	\cite{Bonneau2014ReliableStorage56Bits}
	\cite{Forget2007HelpingUsers}
	
	It might be worthwhile to add a gamification layer onto password managers if you want to memorize some of your most important passwords \cite{Kroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication}\\
	
	\paragraph{Mnemonics}
	Using contextual cues related to a website to base a mnemonic PW on might make them more memorable \cite{Mcevoy2016ContextualizingMnemonicPhrase}
	
	\paragraph{Passphrases}
	(\todo{maybe even merge this with subsection on advice})
	Advantages: PW scheme doesn't have to be changed, people are generally familiar with the concept of passwords, better to enter on virtual keyboards, e.g. TVs (although we don't have any data for that, but that's okay because passwords play a minor role (but still exist there)).
	
	Mnemonic phrase based passwords are strong and memorable \cite{Yan2004PasswordMemorabilitySecurity}.
	
	
	
	Disadvantages: more typos (can be relieved by displaying the password in plain text  \cite{Melicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords}), user choice often predictable
	
	users might not even understand what you want from them if you say they should create a password based on a phrase \cite{Forget2007HelpingUsers}
	
	\cite{Bonneau2012LinguisticProperties}: passphrases already deployed in PGP, Caine and Abel password leak \cite{Carnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters} 
	
	\cite{Shay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple}
	
	
	\paragraph{Pronounceable Passwords}
	pronounceable passwords are useful, but we don't know the best way to generate them \cite{Goldberg2015UnspeakablePasswords}

	%% from SOUPS MM Poster
	We situate our work in understanding user behavior and attitudes regarding passwords. Here, large parts of the literature focus on \textit{coping strategies} that emerge with a growing number of accounts \cite{Florencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits, Florencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser}. For example, Stobert and Biddle conducted qualitative analyses to formalize the way users live with their passwords (the ``Password Life Cycle") \cite{Stobert2014PasswordLifeCycle}. This model depicts how users choose, commit, reuse, and reset their passwords. Their work also delivers valuable insights into memorization and organization strategies: Users have mental lists of passwords, e.g. a list for important accounts or a list per website topic. Without explicitly mentioning, the findings contribute to a mental model of password reuse. This is important, because reuse is one of the most common coping strategies \cite{Das2014TangledWeb, Gaw2006PasswordManagement, Hayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs} and many researchers discourage it, because a breach at one site can compromise many others \cite{Bonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing, Komanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople}. 
	
	To facilitate coping with passwords and possibly minimize reuse, dedicated tools have been investigated and proposed. Besides industry-driven password managers, HCI research has proposed a number of alternatives. For instance, Stobert and Biddle also propose a password manager that is designed to boost trust as it does not directly store passwords, but rather offers a image cues to recall passwords \cite{Stobert2014PWMThatDoesntRemember}. 
	
	Finally, other researchers followed a mental model approach to understand how users make sense of security mitigations. For instance, Kang et al. utilized drawing tasks to establish users' mental model of data disclosure on the Internet \cite{Kang2015MentalModelsDrawing} to find guidelines for more privacy-sensitive solutions. Bravo-Lillo et al. focused on creating a mental model of security warnings \cite{BravoLillo2011WarningsMentalModel} to improve their framing and timing.
