\section{Background and Context}

Zhang-Kennedy \etal provided very detailed literature review and took a look at the recommendations given to users. They come to the conclusion that reuse is not necessarily bad \cite[p.8-9]{ZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules}. In fact, they provide an updated recommendation that is ``strategically reuse passwords''. In this chapter, we report on the design, implementation and evalaluation of a password manager that puts ``strategic reuse'' at its core.
