\chapter[Proof-of-Concept: Password Reuse Manager]{Proof-of-Concept: Password Reuse Manager}\label{chap:pwrm}

\section{Background and Context}

Zhang-Kennedy \etal provided very detailed literature review and took a look at the recommendations given to users. They come to the conclusion that reuse is not necessarily bad \cite[p.8-9]{ZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules}. In fact, they provide an updated recommendation that is ``strategically reuse passwords''. In this chapter, we report on the design, implementation and evalaluation of a password manager that puts ``strategic reuse'' at its core. 


Maqbali and Mitchell talk about a reuse algorithm implemented in their ``AutoPass'' prototype \cite{Maqbali2016PasswordGenerators}.
``site-specific'' pseudorandom passwords

``Password managers often have poor support for roaming and inadequately studied usability [3].'' \cite{Herley2012PersistenceOfPasswords}

\section{Design Iterations and Evaluations}

``defining appropriate categories of websites for re-use of passwords of varying strengths is an open area of research;'' \cite{Wash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices}
