<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent" >This thesis analyzed a multitude of aspects that need to be considered when we try to support users
in password authentication with persuasive design. Hereby, the following research questions were
addressed:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">What is the role of psychological factors and mental models for password selection
      and coping strategies?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">How can password authentication be simplified for users?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">How  can  we  design  persuasive  strategies  to  support  users  in  any  password-related
      tasks?</li></ul>
<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >Since password authentication has been under investigation for several decades, we first delimited
the landscape of related work in Part <a 
href="disspa1.html#x7-45000I">I<!--tex4ht:ref: part:related_work --></a>. This helped us find pointers to all three research questions
and identify open topics that had still been underexplored (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch4.html#x72-1190004">4<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:rw:summary --></a>). In Parts <a 
href="disspa2.html#x73-122000II">II<!--tex4ht:ref: part:problem_space --></a> and <a 
href="disspa3.html#x102-272000III">III<!--tex4ht:ref: part:design_space --></a>, we
reported on a number of empirical experiments and explorative research studies to investigate both
human factors and environmental constraints of password authentication. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">RQ1 </span>was mainly
investigated with online studies in the wild and with survey methods. We explored the
mental models of password strength by innovating a research method to inexpensively
collect data in the wild. Moreover, we conducted multiple surveys to explore associations
between personality and attitudes and behaviors in authentication. We tried to answer
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">RQ2 </span>with mixed methods, both on the qualitative and the quantitative side. Here, we
explored the needs users have in persuasive feedback with a survey and participatory
design approach, and derived a solution based on the Decoy effect and emojis inside
text-based passwords. Finally, to answer <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">RQ3</span>, we discussed a framework to guide the
design of persuasive strategies in Chapter <a 
href="dissch12.html#x122-37000012">12<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:perdespassup --></a>, which we then also applied to create a novel
password-manager. The following sections discuss the central insights and show how they are
connected.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x126-39400013.1"></a>Psychological Factors and Mental Models in Authentication</h5>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent" >In Chapter <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-760003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:rw:user_perspective --></a>, we found that most related work <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">describes </span>coping strategies. Only sometimes the
contributing factors like educational background, psychographics, or mental models that foster
certain coping strategies are addressed.
</p><!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >We filled this gap in several ways. First, we investigated the mental models of password strength,
because these are believed to be highly influential on actual password choice. For these purposes,
we innovated on research methods to understand latent password strength perceptions: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">PASDJO</span>,
the password game, helped in showing that passphrases are often underestimated by users, although
<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:NIST">NIST</a> has started to propagate them in favor of highly complex passwords (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>). The
long-standing belief that strong passwords must include a wide range of characters was
clearly visible in the data collected during one year of public deployment. However,
users were by and large capable of judging the quality of passwords. We take this as
evidence that users are most likely aware of their actions when they select either strong and
weak passwords for different purposes. This insight gives rise to a shift in the way we
support users in password selection: In many cases it is unnecessary to provide feedback
on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strength</span>, because users can already estimate it well. Therefore, we can tackle other
risky behaviors. In fact, password strength is often a secondary risk factor, if users reuse
passwords too carelessly. To investigate the real-world constraints for password reuse, we
audited the composition policies of the 83 most visited web-sites in Germany (see Chapter
<a 
href="dissch6.html#x83-1610006">6<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:policies_reuse --></a>). We were able to show that it is easy for users to reuse a single password on most
sites: it only has to be nine or ten characters long and consist of lower- and uppercase
letters and digits. Hence, this finding is another indication that password policies have
shaped the mental model that at least three different character classes are absolutely
required to form a strong password – and that reuse is less critical, because it is not
prevented. Moreover, users do not need a password manager if their go-to passwords are
accepted by most websites. However, as soon as they add symbols in the belief that
doing so fosters password strength even more, the success rate to reuse the resulting
password drops significantly. So, in that case, rejecting passwords based on certain symbols
might leave users wondering why these do not boost password strength. The result is a
cognitive dissonance in the users’ mental models. To resolve this, websites could provide
some kind of explanation as to their policy choice, but most fail to do this. Besides, it is
unlikely that they disallow certain symbols to hamper password reuse. As a take-away,
service providers need to start accepting Unicode passwords without arbitrary length
restrictions to avoid confusing users. This allows automatically generating unique passwords
of all kinds, which can drive the adoption of password managers. At the same time,
Unicode passwords have more ramifications on the use of emojis, which we discuss in a
moment.
</p><!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Real-world constraints like composition policies shape mental models and coping strategies. On the
other hand, there is a spectrum of password coping strategies that cannot be explained by
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
environmental factors alone. We hypothesized that a user’s personality might play a role in
password selection and coping behavior. In three studies (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>), we examined how
personality might be associated with different password tasks. We found that personality was a
weak, but non-negligible factor in predicting how different user groups deal with policies,
perceive strength, or choose passwords. The data allowed us to create user segments in
the form of personas that can be used in the development of authentication schemes
and support strategies. As a side effect, we observed that people with a background
in an IT-related field were more likely to adopt a password manager. Looking at the
generally low adoption rates of such software, we explored how users perceive password
managers in Chapter <a 
href="dissch8.html#x98-2470008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:mental_models_pwm --></a>. We contributed the observation that users appreciate this kind of tool
once they were first exposed to the technology, e.g. at work. If they had never used a
password manager before, they were unable to anticipate how it might help them. We
distinguished important themes that shape mental models about password managers. However,
we found that these models were currently not fully matched by commercial software.
Consequently, there are novel opportunities to re-design password-managers to better support
users.
</p><!--l. 32--><p class="noindent" >In summary, we have to understand additional dimensions of the factors that contribute to mental
models, because if we do not, we will fail to help users avoid risky password practices.
Environmental constraints like password policies probably have the largest influence. Much
traditional advice on how to form “good passwords” has led to a skewed mental model of password
strength. Second, professional and educational factors are associated in how well users deal with
password tasks. Finally, personality also contributes to the shaping of mental models, and warrants
further research in this direction.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x126-39500013.1"></a>Simplification Strategies</h5>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >Our exploration of mental models and other psychological factors in password authentication
revealed that users meet complex tasks with their individual simplification strategies. Especially if a
website implements a complex password policy, users often try to get away with as little effort as
they can, which results in predictable secrets. To prevent this and offer alternative simplification
strategies, researchers have tried numerous approaches. One of them is based on real time
feedback during password selection that shows how well the password meets the policy
and how strong it is. Many different variations of feedback have been proposed (e.g.,
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">99</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">343</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XVance2013FearAppeals">347</a>]</span>), but the designs have mostly been based on assumptions about the
users’ needs in simple password feedback. We took a different approach and first tried to validate
our assumptions and identify aspects that fell short in the related literature. Through a
mixed methods approach (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch9.html#x103-2730009">9<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:feedback_modalities --></a>) we specified user needs and found four central
dimensions of password selection support: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">showing </span>current problems, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">explaining </span>the
implications, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">helping </span>with improvement, and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">empowering </span>to become creative. These dimensions
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
can be used to facilitate password selection trough feedback and feedforward in future
solutions.
</p><!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, to address the users’ needs and to simplify password selection, we explored two
persuasive strategies. The first was based on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">showing </span>current problems and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">helping </span>with
improvement. We introduced a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">choice architecture </span>for password selection based on the Decoy
effect (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch10.html#x106-30600010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:decoy --></a>). Through an online experiment, we observed that the Decoy choice
architecture did not influence participants as expected. However, displaying a passphrase and
making its benefits more visible and easily comparable did result in stronger and longer passwords.
Thus, we believe that such a combination of feedback and feedforward is the key to simplifying
selection strategies for stronger passwords. Although it is not necessary to pick a strong
password for every single account, it is very recommendable to reduce guessability of
master-passwords for password managers. The second strategy we explored aimed to simplify
memorization of passwords and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">empower </span>users to become creative in their selection. To that end,
we evaluated the usability of using emojis inside text-based passwords in two study
sessions (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch11.html#x110-33200011">11<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:emojipasswords --></a>). We created a prototype to enter emoji-passwords that allowed us
to measure selection patterns and issues arising from different visual representations
of the same set of emojis across platforms (<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fragmentation</span>). For our participants, the
concept brought about the intrinsic desire to create more memorable passwords than
what is usually possible, thus the simplification approach went in the right direction.
However, once participants faced trouble recognizing the right emojis because their
visual style had changed, this fragmentation lowered memorability and participants
were reserved towards adopting emoji-passwords in the future. So, although the concept
generated interest at first, usability troubles outweighed the anticipated benefits. In one of the
personality studies (Chapter <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>), we had found that certain user groups were more inclined to
adopt emoji-passwords than others: they were more acceptable for participants who
strongly showed the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Neuroticism </span>trait. Hence, it is very likely that those users will try
to create emoji-passwords in the near future, because some services like Twitter and
Slack already support them. Therefore, the usability issues that we identified need to be
addressed soon to avoid user frustration due to account lock-outs and inefficient input.
Only then will emoji-passwords become a true <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">simplification </span>strategy, because right
now they miss this target. In conclusion, the task of password creation can be simplified
for users through careful tuning of the password policy, feedback, feedforward, and
empowerment.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x126-39600013.1"></a>Guiding Persuasive Designs</h5>
<!--l. 46--><p class="noindent" >One interesting aspect of the persuasive solutions presented in related work is that they rarely
explain the design process in forming them. Reading the literature gives the impression that
solutions are solely derived from isolated ideation and/or related work. Important iteration stages of
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
the human-centered design process are often underrepresented and it stays unclear what led to
different design choices. To identify new opportunities and exhaust the design space, I argued
to structure the process and activities specifically for the design of password support
solutions.
</p><!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >To that end, I developed a framework that takes all the insights from related and original work into
account. The Persuasive Design for Password Support (P4P) framework addresses specific tasks
and questions of password authentication, and guides through different stages of the process. At the
same time, it allows taking shortcuts and move directly to a later stage, given that prior work paints
a clear picture of the status quo (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch12.html#x122-37000012">12<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:perdespassup --></a>). To illustrate its usage and applicability, I
demonstrated how it informed different stages of the design of a novel password manager. It
embraces the fact that many people desire to reuse passwords and “stay in charge” of their most
treasured accounts. The password manager thus adapts to the user’s coping strategies to
make the transition smooth. As this is a large software project in an early stage of its
implementation, there is a lot of room for improvement and fine-tuning. We contributed
the minimum viable product (MVP) under an open-source license to facilitate further
development.

<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >Although we tried to minimize sampling bias, we cannot fully rule it out in any of the reported
studies. In total, the fifteen empirical user studies elicited data from 883 people. The surveys were
geographically restricted to Germany, the UK, and the USA, because a) the recruitment tools
included the largest user panels in these areas and b) we were only capable to create questions in
German and English. Similarly, we only recruited participants from the Munich area for interviews
and lab studies. So although we were careful to control for other demographic factors,
the samples were rather homogeneous. Also, 883 participants cannot be representative
for the entire population of Internet users, so we have to be very careful not to draw
specific conclusions about different demographic groups. Future studies will have to
solidify the findings for different contexts and user groups. On the upside, geographic
factors have not been a major influence on password-related problems and solutions

<!--l. 112--><p class="noindent" >Since most of the studies had an exploratory character, there was little room for confirmatory
methods. Hence, we mostly relied on correlations and associations between different
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">dependent </span>variables. This type of research has the disadvantage that larger sample sizes are
required to minimize confidence intervals and to detect latent effects. We did not always
achieve optimal levels of statistical power, which is a caveat that needs to be addressed in
further research. Nevertheless, the findings help to inform future hypotheses and to run
confirmatory studies based on those. In case an independent variable was required to
study a phenomenon, we carefully weighed the benefits and shortcomings of various
study designs. For the decoy and the emoji-passwords studies (Chapters <a 
href="dissch10.html#x106-30600010">10<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:decoy --></a> and <a 
href="dissch11.html#x110-33200011">11<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:emojipasswords --></a>), we
resorted to between-groups settings that usually require a large sample size to achieve high
statistical power. On the plus side, they better show contrasting effects. Moreover, we used
within-groups designs in two out of the three personality studies (Chapter <a 
href="dissch7.html#x88-1780007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pws_and_personality --></a>). This allowed for
a better understanding of individual preferences and was suitable for smaller sample
sizes like in our studies. Exploratory questions make it challenging to anticipate the
outcome in either setting, but additional resources might have enabled us to choose an
alternative study design. Since we were able to answer our research questions satisfactorily,
the choice of our methods was plausible, but future studies might need to reconsider
them.
</p><!--l. 117--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, we refrained from collecting plain-text passwords for ethical reasons. While other
researchers save passwords in clear text, they also need to provide a higher standard of protective
mechanisms, like locking access to the data and analyzing it off-line. Since we did not have the
resources for such procedures, we found it more reasonable to hash passwords if they needed to be
stored. This limits the available depth of post-hoc analyses, which is a caveat. At the same time, the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
consistent usage of the zxcvbn estimator provided sufficient and reliable details about passwords
for the analyses we required. We did, however, have to modify it in order to strip it from sensitive
information.

<!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >Apart from the log analysis of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">PASDJO</span>, we could not collect data <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">in the wild</span>. The concepts we
evaluated in Part <a 
href="disspa3.html#x102-272000III">III<!--tex4ht:ref: part:design_space --></a> were not yet mature enough to warrant production-level deployment of the
nudges. We tried to increase ecological validity by following established practices in password
research (cf. Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-770003.1">3.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:methodology --></a>). While these attempts let us assume that participants immersed
themselves in the tasks, there is always a small gap between study and real-world contexts.
Therefore, we have to leave deployments of our concepts, e.g. emoji-passwords or feedforward
techniques, to future work. Moreover, coming back to recommendation <a 
href="#x126-3970065">5<!--tex4ht:ref: recommendation:method_space --></a>, we might be able to
assess the ecological validity of the existing data through ethnographic methods, e.g. diary studies
or contextual inquiry.

<!--l. 126--><p class="noindent" >Studying the users’ psyche, like cognitive biases and personality, to aid the design of
persuasive interventions bears certain ethical risks. Often, we investigate unconscious
phenomena, for instance, how the decoy effect influences users’ decision-making.
Therefore, we need to always consider how findings in this area might be exploited.
There was a recent episode of questionable analysis of personality profiles: Cambridge
Analytica, a British political consulting firm, accessed millions of Facebook users’ data
without their consent to target political campaigns based on their personality and other
factors<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss128.html#fn2x52"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x126-403001f2"></a>.
Although studying users’ personality to support them in password authentication appears less
critical than politically motivated manipulation techniques, we still have to weigh the benefits
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
against the risks. For instance, if future research corroborates our findings about the associations
between personality and password selection, this might allow adversaries to target attacks more
efficiently. Thus, the P4P framework includes this important aspect in the hope of seeing more
discussions of ethical risks in the future.
