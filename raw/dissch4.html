<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >The current landscape of password research deals with both technical (Chapter <a 
href="dissch2.html#x8-460002">2<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:rw:passwords --></a>) and human
factors (Chapter <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-760003">3<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:rw:user_perspective --></a>). From a system-design perspective, we can take away the following state of the
world:
      </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">There  have  been  numerous  attempts  to  replace  passwords,  but  none  of  them  are  a
      panacea, because they entail a number of disadvantages that thwart their adoption. Any
      authentication scheme needs to withstand a plethora of attacks, but passwords seem
      to offer the best trade-off regarding usability, deployability and security compared to
      other schemes. Single-Sign On, multi-factor, as well as biometric authentication have
      gained importance and are likely to be further adopted in the future. Especially implicit
      biometric approaches can complement password-based authentication.

class="enumerate-enumitem">Entropy as a password strength proxy only works for system generated passwords.
      Thus, the results of a number of studies would need to be reassessed or replicated
      through new studies. As of now, the most reliable metric is performing actual guessing
      attacks  on  passwords.  Configuring  attacks  is  not  trivial  but  crucial  for  the  results.
      Currently, the <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PGS"></a> (<a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:PGS"></a>) is seen as the most robust tool. If cracking is impossible to determine
      password strength (e.g. for proactive password checks), the best proxy is to estimate
      a guess number for skillful, informed, and resourceful attackers. Neural networks and
      zxcvbn are among the most useful strength proxies at this point, but it is worthwhile
      to triangulate to obtain the full picture.

class="enumerate-enumitem">Password strength is difficult to agree upon and highly context dependent. This makes
      it hard to give homogeneous, consistent advice to users.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent" >The technical aspects are contrasted and complemented by these human factors:
      </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Users need to manage many password-protected accounts, which is one of the drivers
      to  come  up  with  individual  coping  strategies.  Although  these  strategies  are  often
      intuitively developed, they show commonalities among larger user groups. Passwords
      go  through  a  life-cycle  no  matter  what  strategy  is  used.  A  large  part  of  the  users’
      password practices can be classified as risky, but in many ways they remain rational.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Users tend to select predictable passwords, reuse them often, and write them down in
      physical or digital notes. While there are many hypotheses to explain user behavior,
      the problem is probably too nuanced to reach a final consensus regarding its origins.
      It appears to be an assessment we need to make on a per-user level.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Many  solutions  have  been  proposed  to  guide  and  support  users.  Policies  enforce
      requirements  on  users  to  mitigate  strength  issues.  However,  the  design  space  of
      password policies is large and the best parameters are context dependent. Policies do
      not  guarantee  “better”  passwords,  but  real  time  feedback  can  make  the  restrictions
      more  bearable.  Password  managers  can  take  some  responsibility  from  users  which
      had been shifted to them in previous years. Explicit user education was once seen as
      primary tool to combat risky behavior, but users continued to dismiss it, which has led
      to the understanding that education alone does not solve all problems.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   4. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Persuasive design has been a well-studied area in password authentication to aid user
      education.  It  leverages  cognitive  biases  and  heuristics  to  achieve  more  secure  user
      behavior. Password meters encompass many persuasive strategies at once and offer
      an interesting design space to influence password selection. However, their real-world
      implementations have brought inconsistencies to light, which reduced their persuasive
      power.
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   5. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Studying passwords has a multitude of facets and the method toolkit is large. Most
      studies rely on online-surveys (especially through <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:mTurk">mTurk</a>), usability tests in the lab,
      or qualitative interviews. Several principles for the design of valid studies in usable
      security and privacy have emerged in the past two decades.</dd></dl>

<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Based on the review of the related literature we can identify a number of questions that have not
been answered to their full extent.
      </p><dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Since  results  regarding  user  behavior  and  knowledge  about  password  strength  are
      mixed, we still have not uncovered all context-factors and exploratory variables for
      password selection. However, we need to have this kind of understanding if we aim
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
      to  design  better  support  systems  to  either  reinforce  or  break  certain  habits.  Since
      user  education  has  been  going  on  since  decades,  we  ask:  What  have  users  learned
      about password security in the meantime? What are their mental models of password
      strength and how do they change over time? Can we trace back certain behavior to
      failed mitigations, or are psychological factors more decisive?
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The  design  space  for  persuasive  interventions  has  not  been  fully  exhausted.  The
      effectiveness of persuasion is still somewhat low. What are novel, radical approaches
      to steer users towards stronger passwords? How do we find them? Which cognitive
      biases might be most suitable for the design of persuasive password interventions?
      Can we find new horizons to empower users to create stronger passwords that are still
      memorable? What would a holistic solution look like?
      </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
   3. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">Password reuse is rampant and still a great risk for users, primarily in the form of
      identity theft following social engineering attacks. However, this aspect has not been
      addressed by the design of password policies. If policies cannot always effectively
      combat weak passwords, do they prevent password reuse? Can persuasive design aid
      the secure reuse of passwords?</dd></dl>
