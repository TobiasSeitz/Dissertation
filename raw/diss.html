 id="x1-20001"></a>Introduction</h2>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >We have become accustomed to using multiple passwords every day: We enter a four-digit
PIN to unlock our phone to check incoming messages even before breakfast. Paywalls
shield the news of the day, so they force us to log into our favorite news website before
we can read them on the way to work. Once arrived, our fingers automatically type the
password to unlock the computer. A colleague requests access to a client&#8217;s platform, so we
write down the credentials or share them via a password manager that itself is password
protected. When we come home, we find the kids have used the family&#8217;s tablet to log into
their social media accounts, so we need to re-authenticate if we want to check our own.
Interacting with systems relying on password authentication has become ubiquitous,
and we merely carry out the task. Passwords are the de facto standard when it comes to
controlling access to resources on the Internet. While it may seem straightforward to deal with
passwords because we are so acquainted with them, there is a wide range of problems they
entail: The phone requests the PIN whenever we take it out of our pocket, so we spend
considerable time per day authenticating <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>. The news website informs us that our
password has expired, so we need to pick a new one that is not part of the ones we had used
before. The work PC requires not only our credentials but also a one-time password that
our phone generates for us every sixty seconds. At one point, the colleague leaves the
company, so we have to request a new set of credentials from the client to maintain
confidentiality. And the kids used the tablet at home to shop online because we had stored
the password in the browser for convenience. So, we delete the stored password but
fail to recall it a week later, because we had not typed it for a very long time. These
and other situations lead to users feeling a considerable burden generated by password
authentication.
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-30001.1"></a>The State of the World</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >In a wide sense, password authentication encompasses digit-only personal identification numbers
(PINs), graphical schemes like the Android screen lock pattern (see Section 2.5.1), and
alphanumeric passwords consisting of letters and digits. Throughout this thesis, however, we focus
on the latter because they still are the go-to method on the Internet: In 2007, users had around 25
accounts and roughly six distinct passwords on average <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">112</a>]</span>, while more recent numbers suggest
that users keep twelve unique passwords for different purposes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">359</a>]</span>. With the growing number of
accounts the issues around passwords amplify: users pick weak passwords, write them
down in unprotected locations, reuse many of them, forget the exotic ones, and share
credentials with other people <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span>. These behaviors are referred to as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password coping</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strategies</span>.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Combating the risks entailed by these issues, researchers and practitioners have developed
numerous approaches to support users in password authentication. Four central themes have
emerged in their efforts: education, enforcement, assistance, and persuasion.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-40001.1"></a>Education</h5>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Weak password practices were attributed to a lack of understanding of their consequences for the
longest time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2001WeakestLink">272</a>]</span>. Thus, first approaches to mitigate the situation leaned on educating users
through trainings, and textual instructions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2009SoLongThanksExternalities">162</a>]</span>. Explaining all risks and defense strategies to users
in lengthy prose is doomed to fail, because password security is a secondary goal that is
dominated by a primary task, e.g., reading emails <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWhitten1999WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt">367</a>]</span>. Nevertheless, carefully crafted
advice and explanations may be a viable strategy for those who actively seek information
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">273</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 20--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-50001.1"></a>Enforcement</h5>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >Since the inception of passwords in the 1960s, users have tried to create memorable passwords that
are often based on simple dictionary words. To combat low complexity, enforcing password rules
through policies is commonplace. Passwords must meet length and complexity requirements,
e.g., a certain number of uppercase letters, digits, or symbols. The choice of a specific
policy is not trivial for service providers, and many organizations make poor tradeoffs
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">113</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">291</a>]</span>. The plethora of policies even fosters insecure password practices, because users
try to find easy ways to comply with the rules, which they do in very predictable ways
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">199</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XUr2015PWCreationLab">341</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-60001.1"></a>Assistance</h5>
<!--l. 24--><p class="noindent" >Users have to deal with a high number of passwords that also interfere with each other, so people
reuse passwords and write them down on paper or digital files. To lower the risks entailed by these
coping strategies, assistive tools like password managers (PWMs) and password generators
automate certain interactions to boost both security and usability. However, they come
at a price, e.g., lock-in effects to a particular vendor that make it difficult to move to
a different tool in the future. Thus, many users rationally refrain from adopting them
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCSID2012PasswordHabits">65</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-70001.1"></a>Persuasion</h5>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the youngest strategy to support users in password authentication is based on principles of
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">persuasive technology</span>. Fogg defined this paradigm as &#8220;any interactive computing system designed
to change people&#8217;s attitudes and behaviors&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFogg2002Persuasive">120</a>, p. 1]</span>. While assistive systems often that goal,
persuasive technology tries to create sustainable impact even when the assistive trigger is absent.
Therefore, such interventions often come as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">behavior-change support system </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOinas-Kukkonen2013BCSS">243</a>]</span>. In the realm of
authentication, password meters are the most representative form of persuasive interventions. Those
user interface (UI) elements often appear on registration pages of web services, and give
feedback on the strength of a user-selected password. They often implement various
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">nudges</span>, i.e. a small, transparent attempt to change behaviors <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XThaler2008Nudge">328</a>, p. 4]</span>, to convince the
user to pick a more suitable password. The user stays in control and is free to move on
without following the advice, which is perhaps the biggest challenge in the design of
persuasive password support. So far, the use of nudges has shown mixed results in empirical

<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >Password-related challenges and risks for the users are at the heart of this dissertation. The balance
between usability and security, especially for passwords, has been under investigation for several
decades. This allows us to observe tectonic shifts in the hassles that users have to deal with. The
notion of the inconsiderate user, who is the &#8220;weakest link&#8221; in the authentication chain and
notoriously refuses security measures, has started to crumble: There is considerable evidence that
many users want more control over their security and that they are willing to sacrifice usability for
it <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKessem2018IBMFutureIdentity">191</a>]</span>. This might not even be necessary, or lie in their best interest, which I illustrate
below.

usable but risky password practices, like excessive reuse and obvious password choices, can cause
financial damage for end-users. For instance, an attacker who manages to impersonate a user might
be able to withdraw money from bank accounts. At the moment, attacks on digital wallets
containing cryptocurrency are highly lucrative, so protecting these assets with strong passwords is
vital<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></span><a

 id="x1-110001.2.1"></a>Striving for Stronger Password Practices</h5>
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >At the other end of the security-usability spectrum, moving to strong password practices often
inflates usability challenges for users that are largely neglected by security experts. For
instance, typing an overly complex password takes long and is error prone <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>]</span>. Such
passwords are especially tedious to enter on mobile phones or devices that were not
originally designed for text input, e.g., smart TV sets <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">229</a>]</span>. Moreover, most people are
incapable of creating and memorizing a strong, unique password for every single account on
their own. So, it is unrealistic to expect that they will do so without the use of external
aids like handwritten notes or password managers. The cost of using such methods is a
dependency on the tools that users did not ask for. In any case, strong passwords are no
panacea in boosting online security. They do not stand a chance in fending off social
engineering attacks where the victim unwillingly surrenders the password in plain text. In an
effort to alleviate the risks of unknowingly forfeited credentials, service providers often
require users to reset passwords after a given period. Such expiration policies are rather
ineffective <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XChiasson2015QuantifyingExpiration">54</a>]</span> and responsible for many support desk calls whose resolutions are costly

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-120001.2.2"></a>Improving an Innately Annoying Interaction</h4>
<!--l. 51--><p class="noindent" >Passwords are annoying for users, and as we can see above, there is no easy solution to alleviate
this situation. It is impossible to remove all usability pain points <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">35</a>]</span>. Yet, no alternative can fully
replace passwords, either (see Section 2.5). Thus, Herley and Van Oorschot point out that
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">&#8220;supporting passwords better is a vast opportunity for improvement&#8221; </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>, because making even a
small change can have an impact on so many users.
<!--l. 53--><p class="noindent" >So far, persuasive strategies have produced mixed results regarding their efficacy in
supporting users with passwords. This could be due to several issues: Mental models and
coping strategies evolve over time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">348</a>]</span>, which has seen little attention in the design
of persuasive interventions. Much of the past research dealt with one-shot triggers in
isolation, but many context factors and costs for different stakeholders were left out. In an
analogy to the design principle &#8220;form follows function&#8221;, a better understanding of the
functions of user support can help design assistive and persuasive solutions (the form).
Moreover, many highly effective nudges from other domains have not been adapted for
password support, so we simply may not have discovered the best intervention, yet.
However, since nudging strategies are nuanced, we need a structured exploration of
how we can bring them to password authentication to remove its most important pain
points.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-140001.3"></a>Main Contributions</h3>
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >As highlighted above, several aspects of password support have been left out in the literature,
although there are many reasons to consider their importance. First and foremost, a broader
understanding of contextual factors that contribute to the formation of specific coping strategies is
necessary to improve password support. The primary goal of this thesis is to provide this
understanding on a fundamental level by exploring existing factors and addressing them with
persuasive designs. The solutions include new paradigms for the design of persuasive
interventions.
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-150001.3"></a>Insights into Context Factors of Password Practices</h5>
<!--l. 69--><p class="noindent" >Researchers seem to have reached consensus that the context in which a password goes through its
life-cycle <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span> is an exploratory variable for users&#8217; practices. However, contextual factors have
merely been addressed in the discussions of empirical findings. Only a few studies specifically
correlated users&#8217; backgrounds to their password practices (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKessem2018IBMFutureIdentity">191</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XMazurek2013Measuring">224</a>]</span>) and they
mostly focused on demographic factors. We contribute several insights that enrich the
understanding of a wider range of context factors. Specifically, we address users&#8217; mental
models are associated with their password practices. We do this through a novel method
to study mental models in-the wild with the aid of a game. Moreover, we are the first
to thoroughly investigate the interconnection between personality traits and password
authentication. The insights gathered through three online studies revealed interesting associations
between personality, attitudes, and behaviors regarding passwords. Lastly, we performed an
extensive audit of the real-world constraints that set the context for password reuse. All these
insights shape our understanding of the problem space as the foundation for persuasive
interventions.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-160001.3"></a>Investigation of Persuasive Strategies</h5>
<!--l. 73--><p class="noindent" >With the context factors in mind, we extended the range of persuasive design strategies. As a
starting point, we investigated users&#8217; explicit, tacit, and latent needs of password feedback. From
this exploration, we contribute the &#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">show-explain-help-empower</span>&#8221; paradigm that serves as a
heuristic for persuasive password assistance. We followed this up with two studies that were carried
out both in the lab and in the field: The first study was the first of its kind to evaluate
the Decoy effect for choice architectures in password authentication. Here we learned
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
important lessons about the interplay between feedback and feedforward, and about the role
of simplification in persuasion. The second study was focused on empowerment. We
evaluated different dimensions of usability of emojis inside text-based passwords. The study
delivers timely insights, because an increasing number of web-services enable users to
pick such emoji-passwords and there are some issues that need attention from the very
start.

password authentication are melted into a framework for structuring future design processes in this
domain. I contribute the Persuasive Design for Password Support (P4P) framework. It respects the
dynamism of the status quo, aids in finding the right interventions, and implementing them
successfully. To that end, we present a design exercise that demonstrates how the P4P framework
can be used.

<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" >Passwords are but one puzzle piece in the realm of cyber security. They are part of the access
control paradigm, which is commonly divided into three steps: identification, authentication, and
authorization <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRiley2006IdentityAuthenticationDistinct">264</a>]</span>. Identifying a user is usually done with a prompt for a user name, so the
system tries to answer the question &#8220;who are you?&#8221;. Authentication is about proving that a
user &#8211; or more broadly an entity &#8211; is who they claim to be, i.e. authentication is about
verification of an identified entity. In other words, the system asks &#8220;How can you prove that
you are who you claim to be?&#8221;. This verification process can be based on three central
elements, namely something that you know (any kind of secret), something that you are (any
kind of property), or something that you have (any kind of secret token). One could
argue that the second category could be extended by &#8220;something that you do?&#8221;, e.g.
provide your individual signature. However, authentication does not necessarily <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">require</span>
identification as a first step. It is well possible to authenticate entities even if they are
anonymous. One everyday example are passwords for WiFi networks: Most of the time, the
access point does not require a user name; the password, or pre-shared key, in a WPA
protocol is enough to join the network. Last, authorization is the decision over which
resources an authenticated entity is allowed to use, or an answer to &#8220;can the user access
this?&#8221;.
<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent" >For this thesis, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">authentication </span>remains the center of attention. In this chapter, we take a
look at various forms of authentication and establish an argument as to why &#8220;something
that you know&#8221; is still the most prevalent and significant authentication paradigm to
date.

The story already illustrates password misuse, because Ali Baba was not the rightful owner of the
den and he impersonated the thieves. Nonetheless, this authentication paradigm was brought to the
digital world in the early 1960s by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)

Researchers had built a mainframe computer that was programmable by multiple users. At the time,
one of the most valuable resources beside the physical device was the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">time </span>granted to use the
machine. Thus, the Compatible Time Sharing System (CTSS) was conceived to give every user a
certain quota of hours to operate the computer. The quota was enforced by creating user accounts
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
that were password protected. The interaction very much resembles what we still use today:
after typing the user name, the password is requested and hidden from the screen during
entry.

He desired more usage time, so he needed to impersonate other users of the computer and use their
quota. The list of passwords on the system was not well protected, which allowed him to access the
credentials and carry out what was probably the first password exploit in computer history. Scherr
benefited from the fact that passwords were kept in plain text and could be accessed
with a special punch card. Interestingly the attack was not detected immediately. Morris
and Thompson mention strange behavior in their 1979 paper and blame the issue on
a &#8220;software design error&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a

With the rise of the UNIX operating system in the 1970s, encrypted passwords became standard.
One of the cornerstones was the Data encryption standard (DES) which was developed by IBM and
propagated by the US National Bureau of Standards (today called the National Institute
of Standards and Technology, NIST) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBishop1995ProactivePasswordChecking">26</a>]</span>. This algorithm was widely used until the
late 1990s when computing power was sufficient to efficiently carry out attacks, which
rendered DES infeasible. At the time, the Advanced Encryption Standard had already been
proposed and was able to replace in a straightforward manner, so the issue was resolved
quickly.

The surge of the Web has lead to many services requiring authentication. Alphanumeric passwords
were the go-to solution because the system is easy to implement and has almost no set-up costs
other than a database. This has led to passwords becoming the de-facto standard for authenticating
users on the Web.
<!--l. 30--><p class="noindent" >However, passwords do have shortcomings for all the stakeholders involved in the authentication
process, e.g. users who struggle with remembering a multitude of passwords, or service providers
who need to deal with leaked passwords. Consequently, there have been many attempts to replace
passwords as a whole to either minimize security risks, make things easier for the users, or
&#8211; ideally &#8211; both at the same time. To this point, though, no alternative authentication
mechanism has been able to fully replace alphanumeric passwords on the web, which we
investigate in detail in Section 2.5. Put short, the benefits provided by passwords outweigh the
drawbacks most of the time. Table 2.1 has a high-level overview of the benefits and
drawbacks.

<!--l. 37--><p class="noindent" >As mentioned above, computer passwords were attacked shortly after they were called into action.
Attacks have since become more sophisticated. In the first attack on passwords, Scherr benefited
from very weak protection and was able to simply print the passwords and hack into the system.
Nowadays, an attacker, or &#8220;the bad guy&#8221; as Morris and Thompson used to call them <span class="cite">[<a

number of ways to obtain a user&#8217;s password(s). The following sections roughly depict how the

An adversary tries to impersonate the user by trying different combinations of user names and
passwords, which are sent to the authenticating service directly. If successful, the attacker can log
in without the user noticing and steal personal information, act on their behalf, and try to use the
credentials on other services as well. This attack, which is commonly known as an &#8220;online attack&#8221;,
is in many cases thwarted by throttling the number of unsuccessful login attempts per account. The
service provider can lock down a user account entirely after a given number of failed
login attempts. Afterwards, the user either has to manually reset their password, or they
need to wait a certain time until the account is unlocked and new login attempts can
be made. In the latter scenario, a strategy to hamper attacks is to implement a <span

algorithm<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></span><a

as is done in computer networks, e.g. in the Ethernet protocol <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTanenbaum2011ComputerNetworks">324</a>, p. 285]</span>. The idea behind this
scheme is to (exponentially) increase the time a user (or attacker) has to wait until they can
log in again after the account is locked down. Brostoff and Sasse suggest allowing ten
attempts until the account is locked <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBrostoff2003TenStrikes">41</a>]</span>. This should give users enough trials to recover go
through their list of passwords which is usually shorter than ten <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">112</a>]</span>. Though this kind of
countermeasure may seem like the best option, for system providers it comes at a higher price
than for users: A malicious party could easily lock out a large number of users with a
denial-of-service attack. For example, if a lockout policy is in place that invalidates
passwords after 10 failed login attempts, an attacker would only need to take a list of email
addresses (readily available on the Internet) and run 10 or more guesses per user. This
would lock all of them out at once and the financial damage for the service provider to
respond to user requests and/or reactivate accounts manually is probably large. There are
defense strategies for this kind of threat, too, but their success cannot be guaranteed
<span class="cite">[<a

href="#XFlorencio2014AdministratorsGuide">116</a>]</span>. However, if login attempts are not throttled whatsoever, this
can lead to massive attacks, like the largest attack on WordPress to date in December

Florêncio et al. argue that users are well advised to pick passwords that can at least withstand

In this scenario an attacker breaks into the server of a service provider, usually by
exploiting security holes. If this goes unnoticed, the intruder can often access
the entire database containing the user account data. He or she downloads the
data to their own machine, which allows them to use cracking tools like John the

or PassFault <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XPaiva2017Passfault">247</a>]</span>. These sophisticated tools use dictionaries, mangling rules and brute force to
calculate password hashes which are then compared to the entry in the database. If the hashes
match, the password was cracked and its plain text version is written to a file. Optimally, the
passwords in the database are salted and hashed with a slow hash function like bcrypt <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XProvos1999bcrypt">256</a>]</span>, which
drastically reduces an attacker&#8217;s chances to crack the password. At the other side of the spectrum,
the passwords could be stored in plain text, which would not require any cracking automation at
all. Unfortunately, some of the most famous data leaks revealed that data was stored
in plain text. The RockYou breach in 2009 contained 32 Million user accounts for its
gaming website with plain-text passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">33</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">361</a>]</span>. At the time, RockYou developed
games for MySpace and Facebook and the database also contained credentials for these

which made the leak even more severe. Strong passwords would not have helped at all
to avoid losing personal data. Perhaps RockYou&#8217;s loose policy (5 characters) helped
in safeguarding other accounts where more complex policies were in place, because
users were not able to reuse their RockYou password there. In other instances of stolen
password databases, the passwords were indeed hashed, e.g. the infamous LinkedIn

Social engineering has become one of the biggest threats for a user&#8217;s passwords with a growing
number of incidents and fierce financial damage <span class="cite">[<a

who calls himself a social engineer, defines the term like this:

Put simply, an attacker fools a victim into revealing certain kinds of information, including
passwords. The most common social engineering attack on passwords is phishing, which typically
involves two components: a fraudulent website that mimics another service and an email that lures
the user onto this website <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDhamija2006WhyPhishingWorks">86</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSheng2010WhoFallsForAPhish">297</a>]</span>. The email usually utilizes persuasive techniques like scaring
(&#8220;we noticed someone logged into your bank account and you need to reset your password&#8221;) time
pressure (&#8220;you need to act <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">now </span>to avoid further damage&#8221;). If the website looks just like the original
(like the webpage in Figure 2.2), users might fall for it and enter their password to log in. In that
case, it does not matter whether it is a strong, complex password or simply 12345 &#8211;
the attacker knows the username/password combination from that point on <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTari2006ShoulderSurfingComparison">325</a>]</span>. If
this tuple is used on other services, the attacker immediately gains access to them as
well.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >It is very challenging for users to validate the authenticity of a given webpage <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDhamija2006WhyPhishingWorks">86</a>,&#x00A0;<a

the URL is the best indicator, Dhamjia et al. among others argue that it is unrealistic to keep an eye
on the URL at all times. Since the URL and padlock-icons are often ineffective, much research has
been dedicated to help users in this validation and prevent phishing attacks. For example,
Lin et al. found that domain highlighting in the URL bar only has a small effect on the
effectiveness of phishing attacks, even after their participants were explicitly instructed to
take not of the URL <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLin2011DomainHighlighting">211</a>]</span>. Wu et al. showed that browser toolbars do not really help
users, either <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWu2006SecurityToolbars">374</a>]</span>. Dhamija et al. proposed a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">trusted path </span>between the user and the
legitimate service <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDhamija2005DynamicSecuritySkins">85</a>]</span>. In this system, users are supposed to verify the authenticity of a given
website by comparing visual patterns in a trusted window and on the website. Together
with Max-Emanuel Maurer and Alexander De Luca, I created a browser extension to
visualize the usage of different types of SSL certificates across websites through the entire
browser skin <span class="cite">[<a

indicated that changing the browser skins is obtrusive enough to raise awareness and

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Malware and Eavesdropping</span></span>
Secretly stealing plain-text passwords is also possible by infiltrating the user&#8217;s system with
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">malware</span>, which is a term for <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mal</span>icious soft<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">ware </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBayer2009CurrentMalware">20</a>]</span>. One of most common attacks is to install a
keylogger that sends all keystrokes to the attacker. For the most part, this either happens as a
&#8220;drive-by-download&#8221; when the user visits an infected website or by opening a malicious email
attachment <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBKA2016Bundeslagebild">46</a>]</span>. In the former scenario, the sole line of defense lies with the service provider who
needs to make sure their website is not infected. Wash identified that users are aware
of this kind of threat, but their mental model of malware is sub-par <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2010FolkModels">358</a>]</span>. Hence, the
countermeasures taken by the users are often insufficient. As with the phishing scenario, a strong
password is incapable of preventing a malware attack. Ideally, users use an anti-virus
solution, keep their software updated at all times and refrain from opening suspicious email
attachments.
<!--l. 138--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, user credentials can be intercepted in transit, e.g. after the user submits them through a
web form. These so called man-in-the-middle attacks are tough to carry out, but strong passwords
do not prevent them either. One of the typical solutions to minimize the risk is encrypting
the traffic with a secure protocol like SSL/TLS <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTanenbaum2011ComputerNetworks">324</a>, p. 853ff.]</span>, which is based on a
public/private key infrastructure. This makes it harder for an adversary to act as the man
in the middle, because they usually do not possess the necessary private key of either
party. Attackers must tamper with the certificates which usually causes browsers show a
warning <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMaurer2011ShiningChrome">223</a>]</span>. Users, however, do not necessarily understand such warnings, because their
understanding of the technical details is low <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2009SoLongThanksExternalities">162</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWhitten1999WhyJohnnyCantEncrypt">367</a>]</span>. Consequently, the HCI community has

To obtain the password of a specific user, one can also simply watch them enter it and figure out
what the password was. This attack is typically referred to as &#8220;shoulder surfing&#8221; because the person
who watches figuratively &#8220;surfs&#8221; on the user&#8217;s &#8220;shoulder&#8221; to look at their screen <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTari2006ShoulderSurfingComparison">325</a>]</span>. Shoulder
surfing is relatively easy and does not require technical sophistication. But, although friends and
family can carry out such an attack, it is safe to say that it is more problematic in public
spaces where unknown bystanders are present. Typical interactions that take place in such
environments can be found with PIN entry, e.g. on an ATM, or entering any kind of
password on a mobile device, e.g. on a bus in close vicinity to other people. De Luca et al.
dedicated some research to both scenarios. For instance, they investigated contextual factors
during ATM usage and the design space for alternative ATM authentication mechanisms
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeLuca2010UnderstandingATMSecurity">79</a>]</span>. They developed the ColorPIN scheme <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeLuca2010ColorPIN">78</a>]</span>: Additionally to the number sequence,
the user needs to memorize a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">color </span>sequence, e.g. 1 (<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">black</span>) - 2 (<span id="textcolor2"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">red</span></span>) - 3 (<span 
class="colorbox" id="colorbox3"><span id="textcolor4"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">white</span></span></span>) - 4
(<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">black</span>). Entering the PIN is done through indirect input: Instead of prompting the user to
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
enter the digits directly on the keypad, the system displays digits accompanied by three
distinct letters in black, red, and white underneath. The keyboard through which the
ColorPIN is entered, shows each letter three times &#8211; once in each color. To enter the
ColorPIN, the user needs to first identify the correct digit (e.g. &#8220;1&#8221;), and then type the
corresponding letter in the right color (e.g. a black &#8220;Q&#8221;). After each entered character, the letter
assignment is randomized again. All of this makes it challenging for a shoulder surfer to
quickly observe and learn the user&#8217;s PIN by overwhelming their short-term memory
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDunphy2010CloserLookGraphical">89</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, long alphanumeric passwords are a seldom research topic with regard to shoulder
surfing. Shaub et al. looked into the effect of different designs of virtual keyboards on
shoulder surfing susceptibility <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSchaub2012PasswordShoulderSurfing">275</a>]</span>. Somewhat unsurprisingly, they found that keyboards
with more cumbersome access to special characters are less prone to shoulder surfing
because it is harder for an attacker to keep track of the keyboard switches. We can see
in the ColorPIN example, PINs and graphical passwords are more likely to be under
attack. Users usually enter graphical passwords more slowly <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTari2006ShoulderSurfingComparison">325</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWiedenbeck2006ConvexHull">369</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XRenaud2009VisualSnakeOil">261</a>]</span>, which on
the one hand gives an attacker more time to observe, but on the other hand burdens the
short-term memory a bit more. Also, some visual authentication mechanisms require
more screen real estate than a username/password form and entry is often not masked
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBiddle2009GraphicalFirstTwelveYears">24</a>]</span>. Still, there is not a lot of evidence that observation is a severe threat in the real
world, other than for ATM PINs and any kind of credentials of people of public interest.
Herley and Pieters point out that the attack is not scalable via algorithms like offline
guessing <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. Hence, Maguire and Renaud come to the conclusion that &#8220;shoulder-surfing
may well be a non-issue in authentication design&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMaguire2012YouOnlyLiveTwice">217</a>]</span>. Using desktops or laptops to
authenticate on regular websites, observation is rarely a major concern. Passwords are
usually masked in the browser with an asterisk per character. However, this approach has
recently been questioned because it prevents proactive error checking on the user side
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2016DebunkingMyths">274</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 168--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-490002.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Other attacks</span></span>
Apart from the attacks described above, there are other approaches that should not go unmentioned.
First, people in one&#8217;s own social circle, e.g. friends and family, have much personal information and
often physical access to devices and passwords written onto post-it notes. Although the intent is
often not purely malicious, it can be easy for these people to have an informed guess of a
user&#8217;s credentials. Flechais et al. use the term &#8220;spouse attack&#8221; to describe this kind of
threat <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlechais2013SaudiArabiaTrust">110</a>]</span>, Dunphy et al. call it a &#8220;friend attack&#8221;, while Sasse and Flechais framed it
as &#8220;insider attack&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">273</a>]</span>. Ur et al. found that users underestimate its likelihood <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>.
A strong, complex password that is only memorable to the legitimate user might help
in that scenario. Weirich and Sasse, however, argue that such a strategy could make
the user appear &#8220;paranoid&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">364</a>]</span> and Flechais et al. see it as an important sign of trust
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlechais2005DivideConquerTrust">111</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XFlechais2013SaudiArabiaTrust">110</a>]</span>.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 172--><p class="noindent" >Finally, some credentials are shared unintentionally on the web. Software developers who share
open source code on the web are prone to this issue <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XConklin2004PWAuthenticationSystemPerspective">60</a>]</span>. Recently, the node package

An adversary could simply crawl public repositories on GitHub and collect the passwords in plain
text. The npmjs.org operators had to invalidate the credentials to secure the accounts. One solution
that reduces the severity of credential loss is using multi-factor authentication (cf. Section
2.5.3).

<!--l. 196--><p class="noindent" >Bishop and Klein stated in 1995: &#8220;A good password is one that is easily remembered, yet difficult
to guess.&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBishop1995ProactivePasswordChecking">26</a>, p. 231]</span>. The second part of this statement describes password <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strength </span>on a high
level. But there are problems if we try to objectively measure the &#8220;difficulty to guess&#8221; a password:
is it difficult for an attacker with nearly unlimited resources, or only for an attacker that can only
attempt once a day due to lock-out mechanisms? The question is highly context dependent and
there is unfortunately no single true answer.
<!--l. 198--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, while &#8220;<span 
class="ectt-1200">{X@T;cuXw[bJnUH</span>&#8221; is a randomly generated password that seems difficult to
guess, it does not necessarily have to be a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strong </span>password (see Section 2.4): if it was found in a
password database after a data breach, it is likely to be included among the first guesses in
subsequent dictionary attacks. The number of leaked passwords has steadily increased in the past
few years and thus has rendered many such strong passwords unsuitable (see footnote <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). In the
same vein, Yang et al. state: &#8220;If a strategy is widely used, then attackers may develop
strategy-specific methods which can efficiently guess the passwords&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYang2016MnemonicSentenceBased">377</a>]</span>. Economists call this
the &#8220;Tragedy of the Commons&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHardin1968TragedyCommons">156</a>]</span>. This, for example, implies that if passphrases (cf. Section
3.3.3) do become commonplace, attackers will optimize their attack strategy rendering the
well-intended efforts to strengthen passwords less effective. Consequently, the challenge
of considering such effects and realistically measuring password strength has sparked
some discussion, which has led to a small set of suitable models which are discussed
below.

<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >In 1951, Claude Shannon put forward an information-theoretical approach that describes the
encoding of English letters and words <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShannon1951Entropy">288</a>]</span>. In there, he defines the term &#8220;entropy&#8221; as &#8220;<span

<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">parameter, which measures [...] how much information is produced on the average for each letter of</span>
<span

<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">way, the entropy H is the average number of binary digits required per letter of the original</span>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">language</span>&#8221;. In other words, entropy represents the amount of information of a given word in
bits.
<!--l. 207--><p class="noindent" >William (Bill) Burr and his colleagues at NIST took to this understanding and translated it into a
measure for password strength, which was officially published for the first time in 2004 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBurr2004NISTEntropy">48</a>,
Appendix A]</span>. They define &#8220;guessing-entropy&#8221; as &#8220;an estimate of the average amount of work
required to guess the password of a selected user&#8221;. Apart from guessing a single user&#8217;s password,
the macro perspective defines the &#8220;min-entropy&#8221; as &#8220;a measure of the difficulty of guessing the
easiest single password to guess in the population&#8221;. Although many citing publications (e.g.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">100</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">33</a>]</span>) do not sufficiently point it out, Burr et al. explicitly acknowledge the limitation of using
entropy as metric for user-selected passwords. They base their estimate on frequency
distributions, meaning more frequently used passwords are guessed first and are thus lower in
entropy.
<!--l. 210--><p class="noindent" >For random passwords, the NIST guideline gives the following entropy calculation formula.

<!--l. 217--><p class="noindent" >Most users do not use random passwords (for a detailed discussion see Section 3.2), therefore this
kind of entropy calculation is rarely realistic. In other words, the effective or practical password
space is much smaller than the theoretical password space. The NIST guideline tries to take this
into account and gives another calculation approach based on user behavior (see page 49f. in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBurr2004NISTEntropy">48</a>]</span>).
It lists a few entropy heuristics, e.g. the first character gives 4 bits of entropy, the next 7
characters add 2 bits of entropy each, while the 9th through 20th character only add 1.5 bits.
Burr et al. do not provide a formal rationale as to why this was chosen. But again, the
publication specifically points out that this is still an inaccurate approach because this
would require &#8220;examining in detail the passwords that users actually select under the
rules of the password system&#8221;. Moreover, they admitted that &#8220;NIST would like to obtain
more data on the passwords users actually choose, but, where they have the data, system
administrators are understandably reluctant to reveal password data to others&#8221;. In the
meantime, however, there have been many data leaks which fill this hole (see Table
3.1).

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-520002.3.2"></a>Guess Numbers: Markov Models, PCFGs, and Neural Networks</h4>
<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" >Using such leaked data, Weir et al. developed a probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG)
cracking method in 2009 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeir2009PCFG">362</a>]</span>. The idea behind PCFG is that passwords often follow a rather
predictable scheme (e.g. a word followed by a sequence of digits and an exclamation mark,
see Section 3.2). One can model such patterns with so-called mangling rules. Weir et
al.&#8217;s approach was to find a set of mangling rules that crack the most passwords in a
given data set. A mangling rule takes a certain password input and creates one or more
alternative versions of it, for instance the rule could be to replace all occurrences of
the letter &#8220;s&#8221; with the &#8220;$&#8221; symbol (password would become pa$$word). The ultimate
goal is to minimize the number of guesses to crack passwords. Mangling rules also are
essential for password cracking software like John the Ripper or Hashcat, but those tools
primarily use them to generate word-lists, and not for guessing-order optimization. Veras
et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVeras2014SemanticPatterns">344</a>]</span>, as well as Komanduri extended Weir et al.&#8217;s PCFG approach afterwards
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2016Dissertation">197</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 225--><p class="noindent" >A year later, Weir et al. evaluated the usage of the NIST entropy formulae against real-world
passwords and policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">361</a>]</span> to address the issues pointed out by Burr et al.. For the evaluation,
they performed guessing attacks with PCFG on leaked password sets (most notably RockYou). As a
comparison they calculated the NIST entropy for each password and correlated it with cracking
success rates. Their analyses show that the calculated entropies were not satisfyingly
predictive of cracking success, and they concluded that <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">&#8220;there is no way to convert the notion</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">of Shannon entropy into the guessing entropy of password creation policies&#8221;</span>. Weir et
al. thus proposed &#8220;guessing probability&#8221; as a more accurate password strength metric
and the result of an analysis is a kind of lookup-table split into different probability
groups.

policies (more on policies in Section 3.3.1) and tried to crack them. Tuning the right parameters
for cracking by exploiting a priori knowledge (e.g. password policy) led to much more
cost-efficient analyses, but the training still takes approximately 24 hours. However, once
the Markov-chain model is generated, one can simply pass in any kind of password
and retrieve its <span

certain threshold, the password is considered unguessable &#8211; which is also one of the
limitations of the approach. Kelley et al.&#8217;s approach soon became a gold standard to
measure password strength, especially at CMU. Komanduri et al. were probably the
last ones in 2011 that still used entropy as strength metric <span class="cite">[<a

guessing, which has also generated a lot of impact since then <span class="cite">[<a

and tried to attack them in different ways to find patterns in user behavior that could be leveraged in
real-world attacks. Fundamentally, the attacks different in the choice of dictionaries. He found
that the success rates strongly depend on the dictionary that is used for it. He aimed to
translate his findings to a new entropy paradigm and concluded that 10 bits of entropy
are probably enough to defend against online attacks, respectively 20 bits for offline
attacks.

capable of giving the most conservative metric password strength. One of their major
contributions of this work is the Password Guessability Service (PGS) that they since

After successful registration, researchers can upload a file containing plain-text passwords, e.g.
after collecting them through a user study (cf. Section 3.1). The user has to provide a few additional
parameters, like the policy that was utilized, which enhances the guessing efficiency and reliability.
Then a set of cracking approaches are run in parallel and the analysis is sent back to
the uploader. Although this has become an established, state-of-the art tool which has
already been used in numerous publications (e.g., <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGross2016CognitiveDepletion">142</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">365</a>]</span>), it
does not come without caveats. First, passwords need to be uploaded in plain text. This
entails a more careful handling and storage if they originate from a user study, because
users might in fact have used their real-world passwords (see 3.1). Plain-text passwords
also imply that users disclosed them somehow and the mere act of disclosing might
already reduce the strength of passwords, which is not factored into the guess numbers.
However, the team at CMU counteracts this problem by deleting uploads after at most two
weeks. Besides, the analyses are time-consuming, and obtaining results can in fact take
several weeks, because the system is shared with other users. Moreover, if a study aims to
compare multiple password policies, each condition needs to be separately uploaded and
subsequently analyzed. Finally, in personal conversations with the research team, they
pointed out that certain unicode characters are not supported. This makes it infeasible for
passwords that were collected in countries whose languages heavily use umlauts (ä,ö,ü).
Nevertheless, it appears to be one of the best strength proxies the community has at the
moment.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 240--><p class="noindent" >A rather novel approach that has not been integrated into the PGS are cracking algorithms based on
neural networks. Melicher et al. demonstrated an opportunity to configure such algorithms to
perform better than former state-of-the-art techniques like PCFG and Markov models
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">230</a>]</span>. They implemented neural networks based on Monte-Carlo simulations, i.e. &#8220;smart
sampling&#8221; (cf. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDellamico2015MonteCarlo">83</a>]</span>). A thorough evaluation against PCFG, Markov-models, and word-list
crackers showed that neural networks can outperform all of them if properly trained.
Moreover, Melicher et al. were also able to implement their approach in JavaScript.
This highlights one major advantage of using neural networks: once the model has been
trained, it can be packaged and shipped to browsers, which only requires a few hundred
kilobytes. They showed that this type of client-side strength estimation fares really well.
One caveat is that the solution does not work &#8220;out of the box&#8221;. Developers have to train
their models and this means that faulty configurations might lead to erroneous strength
estimations.

It comes with 100,000 tokens which allows zxcvbn to conservatively estimate the guess
numbers. Moreover, it can be extended with site-specific word-lists. Zxcvbn performs its
calculations within milliseconds, which makes it suitable to run strength analyses on
the client. This is a major advantage, e.g., to provide users with real-time feedback on
password strength. Moreover, it can also be easily used on the server to enforce more
advanced password policies, e.g. with NodeJS. Since zxcvbn is open-source, one can
modify and adapt it to meet context-dependent requirements. This makes it extremely
useful for user studies: One can strip sensitive information from the analysis and save
zxcvbn&#8217;s output straight to a database, which is ethically reasonable and speeds up further
analyses.
<!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" >Despite the benefits, one needs to be aware of zxcvbn&#8217;s drawbacks. Carnavalet compared
several real-world password strength estimators, one of which was zxcvbn v2.x <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeCarnedeCarnavalet2015PasswordMeters">74</a>]</span>.
Although they concluded that zxcvbn was the best of the tested estimators, they see
the major limitation in the static dictionary size. Zxcvbn ships with index terms from
the English Wikipedia, English words from TV and movie subtitles, a list of roughly
47000 frequency-ranked passwords, female and male prenames, and surnames from
English-speaking countries. Hence, all words that cannot be matched from these wordlists
including mangling rules, are seen as random strings. Zxcvbn goes on to assume these can only be
cracked by brute force, but real-world attackers possessing a priori knowledge of the target
population might find ways to guess these passwords more efficiently. However, Melicher
et al.&#8217;s neural network suffers from similar limitations. For instance, Carnavalet and
Mannan&#8217;s <span class="cite">[<a

judgmental on its own and depends on whom is asked. A security expert might call a password
&#8220;bad&#8221; if it only contains lowercase letters because she knows how to crack such passwords, but a
regular mainstream user might call it &#8220;bad&#8221; because he cannot type it quickly enough or keeps

when it is good <span

at ATMs. Theoretically, there are only 10000 possible combinations, which could be

      access  to  salted  hashed  passwords  requires  attacker  effort;  long  gone  are  the
      days when password hash files were by default world readable. A disgruntled
      ex-sysadmin who steals hashed passwords is the often-conjectured foe in this
      attack; yet, if untrusted individuals have had unfettered unaudited access to the
      authentication server, a site&#8217;s problems go well beyond password strength. Sixth,
      are  there  ways  to  protect  against  off-line  attacks  besides  password  strength?
      Mandating  password  changes  once  hashes  leak  might  be  better  than  strong
      policies  at  all  times.  Only  if  a  leak  goes  unnoticed  (and  a  password  change
      isn&#8217;t forced) does strength potentially help. Of course, reliably detecting leaks
      or break-ins itself remains difficult. Finally, how much strength is required to
      protect against offline attacks? The bar is clearly much higher than for online
      attacks (assuming lockout or rate-limiting policies in place), but at what strength
      are attacks effectively addressed?&#8221;</div>

href="#XBlonder1996PatentGraphicalPW">30</a>]</span>, which marked the
beginning of a range of new authentication schemes: Graphical (or visual) authentication. The
patent presented a mechanism that prompts the user to prove their identity through correctly
clicking a number of locations in an image. His goal was to find an alternative to text-based
passwords that is easier to remember, without losing security benefits <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBiddle2009GraphicalFirstTwelveYears">24</a>,&#x00A0;<a

the <span

serves as mnemonic device <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGrady1998NeuralCorrelates">139</a>]</span>. A number of studies in HCI demonstrate the benefits
of graphical authentication. For instance, Chiasson et al. report on a lab study which
showed that graphical passwords are easier to remember and less error-prone in the
short term <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XChiasson2009InterferencesGraphical">53</a>]</span>. In the long term, however, there was not significant difference to textual
passwords. Elizabeth Stobert, who dedicated a large part of her PhD work to graphical
passwords <span class="cite">[<a

there are other advantages like personalization and tailoring schemes to specific user

Brostoff and Sasse, found in a field study that users were able to log in with Passfaces even after a
long period of inactivity <span class="cite">[<a

Passfaces, because of the increased authentication time. By random guessing, an attacker would

however, found that user selection of Passfaces is predictable, thus reducing the effective
password space <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDavis2004UserChoiceGraphical">71</a>]</span>. Dunphy et al. created a mechanism that is based on photos <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDunphy2010CloserLookGraphical">89</a>]</span>. In a
two-week field trial they found that participants successfully authenticated in 77% of
attempts, and human attackers needed between 4.5 and 7.5 observations to shoulder-surf the
passwords.
<!--l. 316--><p class="noindent" >Dhamija and Perrig created a similar mechanism called &#8220;Déjà Vu&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDhamija2000DejaVu">84</a>]</span>, where the user selects a
number of random-art images instead of faces (see Figure 2.4 B). Although participants in a lab
study generally liked Déjà Vu, the system was never adopted on larger scope. Another alternative
solution to using faces is VIP, which is based on pictures of objects <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeAngeli2002VIP">72</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XDeAngeli2005PictureThousandWords">73</a>]</span>. They iteratively
improved the prototype, and found that recognizing six simple and concrete objects worked the
best, but was still much slower than entering a PIN. Bicakci et al. also explored authenticating
through clicking a sequence of icons as master password for a password manager <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBicakci2011PWMIconBased">23</a>]</span>. They
found that some icons were more attractive than others and thus impaired security. An
icon-based mechanism that strongly focuses on mitigating shoulder-surfing is Wiedenbeck
et al.&#8217;s Convex-Hull-Click (CHC) system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWiedenbeck2006ConvexHull">369</a>]</span>. The challenge set consists of icons
which are randomly distributed in the grid. The idea behind CHC is that the user does
not click on their enrolled icons, but anywhere inside the convex-hull which is formed
by the icons. In other words, the user clicks a random icon within the virtual polygon
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
that is formed by the icons if they were connected by straight lines. Wiedenbeck et al.
showed that CHC has security benefits, but the large grid of icons negatively impacted
authentication times. Moreover, Golla et al., respectively Kraus et al. recently evaluated emojis
instead of PINs for mobile phones <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGolla2017EmojiAuth">136</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XKraus2017Emoji">202</a>]</span>. Contrary to traditional pins, the emojis
are randomly ordered in the grid, which makes their system a typical &#8220;searchmetric&#8221;
approach. The idea actually originates from &#8220;Emoji passcode&#8221;, a commercial solution
from Intelligent Environments but had never been formally evaluated until their studies

randomly guess. Across all conditions of their user study, most participants were able to log in
successfully even after four weeks. Only those who were given a system-assigned portfolio of

If the user needs to authenticate by clicking specific points in a challenge image (rather than a
challenge <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">set</span>), the mechanism can be classified as <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">locimetric system</span>, from Latin <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">locus </span>= place,
position. Blonder&#8217;s patent application <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBlonder1996PatentGraphicalPW">30</a>]</span> is a classical example. Wiedenbeck et al. evaluated
PassPoints, which in essence is one possible implementations of Blonder&#8217;s idea <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWiedenbeck2005PassPoints">368</a>]</span>.
Security-wise there were benefits over alphanumeric passwords, but usability results were mixed.
Chiasson et al. combined the PassPoints and Passfaces approaches with the Cued Click Point
(CCP) scheme <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XChiasson2007CCP">55</a>]</span>, and the Persuasive Cued Click Point scheme <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XChiasson2008PCCP">52</a>]</span> (CCP). To authenticate, the
user has to click a specific point inside an image (cf. PassPoints) for a sequence of images (cf.
Passfaces). The PCCP version tries to nudge the user to pick less predictable locations (one result
of the CCP-study), which is supposed to further increase the &#8220;strength&#8221; of the graphical
password. Success rates for log-ins were high, but there was no possibility to correct an error,
so participants in the lab study had to start over. Perhaps, this is a caveat in terms of
real-world adoption. Since alphanumerical passwords do have their advantages, Forget et al.
later suggested allowing the user to pick the authentication scheme that best fits their
current context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2015CYOA">125</a>]</span>. Object Passtiles (OPT, another implementation variant of VIP)
and PCCP were the two available graphical authentication schemes. Interestingly, after
study participants tried out a graphical scheme, they later switched back to text-based
passwords.
<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-600002.5.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Drawmetric Systems</span></span>
A third category of graphical authentication are drawmetric systems (also known as recall-based
systems). Here, the user has to either draw a shape configured during enrollment, or perform a
gesture as a kind of virtual drawing. At this point, this is by far the most successful graphical
authentication paradigm, because one such implementation &#8211; &#8220;pattern unlock&#8221; &#8211; was added to the
Android operating system already in its early days <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAviv2010SmudgeAttacks">16</a>]</span>. The idea of drawmetrics most likely has its
origins in the Draw-a-Secret (DAS) scheme by Jermyn et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XJermyn1999DrawASecret">180</a>]</span>. The user is asked
to create a secret drawing in a grid of 16 cells (see Figure 2.5. The system maps the
drawing to simple <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">(x,y) </span>coordinate-pair sequences, but the password space, as disseminated
by Jermyn et al. is large enough to provide sufficient protection of handheld devices.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
Dunphy et al. later aimed to improve the memorability of the drawn shapes and extended
Draw-A-Secret with translucent background images <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDunphy2007BDAS">90</a>]</span>. In a small lab study they observed that
participants had found no striking memorability nor security benefits. Sherman et al.
removed the grid and let the user authenticate with free-form multi-touch gestures, which
required a more sophisticated matching process <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSherman2014UserGeneratedGesturesAuth">298</a>]</span>. This may be part of the reason
the system had equal error rates (EERs) between 3.34 % and 15.97%. The latter case
means that a legitimate user would enter their gesture correctly and not be granted access
in <img 
src="diss6x.png" alt="&#x02DC;1  "  class="tilde" >6% of attempts, while an adversary would gain access just as likely. This makes
the approach rather unsuitable for usage outside the lab. Another hybrid approach that
combines drawmetric with searchmetric authentication is Schlöglhofer and Sametinger&#8217;s
GesturePuzzle <span class="cite">[<a

a challenge set of images, from which the user has to recognize the ones from their
portfolio, the user enters a gesture that corresponds to combination of images. Solving this
puzzle appears too demanding on the user&#8217;s skills and patience to be adopted on larger

<!--l. 348--><p class="noindent" >However, once unlock on Android had become a standard authentication technique for millions of
users, a number of formal evaluations were carried out by the academic community. Harbach et al.
pointed out that participants in their longitudinal study spent around 2.8 minutes on average per day
to unlock their phone&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>. Interestingly, patterns were entered significantly faster than
traditional PINs on average. Regarding their proneness to attacks, it was recognized early that
grid-based patterns on a touchscreen are also prone to &#8220;smudge attacks&#8221; where attackers can
restore the user&#8217;s pattern by looking at the oily residue left on touchscreens after entering
the pattern <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAviv2010SmudgeAttacks">16</a>]</span>. De Luca et al. conceived an approach to authenticate on the back of
smartphones and iterated the concept <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeLuca2013BackOfDevice">80</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XDeLuca2014NowYouSeeMe">77</a>]</span>. Authenticating on the back has the big
advantage to be resilient against shoulder-surfing attacks. Von Zezschwitz et al. also
investigated which specific pattern types were most resilient to shoulder-surfing even
if the attacker can observe them directly <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2015EasyToDraw">352</a>]</span>. Since the pattern unlock on Android
cannot include a given dot multiple times, Colley et al. extended it that way <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XColley2016ExtendingPatterns">59</a>]</span>. This
approach effectively thwarts smudge attacks with a minimal change to the existing system.
Moreover, Uellenbeck et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUellenbeck2013QuantifyingSecurityPatterns">336</a>]</span>, as well as Von Zezschwitz et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2016QuantifyingEffective">353</a>]</span> quantified the
effective pattern space. Both their conclusion was that user-chosen patterns are very
predictable, so the hypothesized security benefits of patterns over PINs are questionable. At the
same time, Von Zezschwitz et al. tried to nudge users to pick a less predictable starting
position with different types of background images <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2016QuantifyingEffective">353</a>]</span>. Their approach resembled
Background-Draw-a-Secret (BDAS) <span class="cite">[<a

evaluating the concept through an online study, the effects on user selected patterns, however,
remained small.

Apart from the pattern unlock for on Android, graphical authentication systems have not been
adopted widely. Text-passwords are still the preferred option for many service providers and are
still available as authentication method on mobile devices. Maybe, we need to improve
understanding as to why the supposed advantages of greater memorability and security have not
been able to outweigh the disadvantages (authentication times, shoulder surfing). As of
know, little is known about the mental models of graphical password security. A step in
this direction was Katsini et al.&#8217;s recent work <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKatsini2017StrategiesGraphicalPasswords">186</a>]</span>. They explored mental models and
strategies that users employ to create graphical passwords. Thorpe et al. also found out
that there are presentation effects that influence how people pick graphical passwords
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XThorpe2014PresentationEffects">330</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 361--><p class="noindent" >For the future, we could narrow down the most feasible direction for visual authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBiddle2009GraphicalFirstTwelveYears">24</a>]</span>. To
get there, Stobert and Biddle compared searchmetric, locimetric and drawmetric systems in terms
of password memorability <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2013GraphicalPasswords">310</a>]</span>. All participants in their study were assigned a system-generated
password to reduce biases. Unsurprisingly, recognition based systems performed better than recall
based systems (&#8220;recognition rather than recall is one of the most important usability heuristics
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XNielsen1994EnhancingHeuristics">239</a>]</span>). Nonetheless, this seems to be the most feasible approach that might see new ideas in
the near future. However, De Angeli and Renaud et al. doubt that visual authentication
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
methods will prevail ub the long run <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeAngeli2005PictureThousandWords">73</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XRenaud2009VisualSnakeOil">261</a>]</span>. They argue that the promise of more
memorable passwords has not been fulfilled by the approaches so far and that we should keep
looking elsewhere. Potentially, we will rely on less knowledge-based authentication in the
future, but more on biometric and multimodal approaches. Those are discussed in the
following.

Those biometric sensors are most commonly used for user identification and authentication. In this

authentication. In an explicit authentication scheme, the user is prompted to provide the proof of
identity, e.g. the fingerprint. The idea behind implicit authentication, as Jakobsson et al. describe
it, is essentially to &#8220;authenticate mobile users based on actions they would carry out
anyway&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a

the most common feature used biometric authentication method nowadays, due to the widespread
device-support (mobile phones, tablets, laptops) and obvious usability benefits as perceived by the
users<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2010FolkModels">358</a>]</span>. On modern phones, after a short enrollment, fingerprint recognition takes a fraction of a
second and has low error rates under normal circumstances <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHenniger2016SecurityEvaluationFingerprint">161</a>]</span>. Thus, fingerprint authentication
is fairly usable and reasonably secure. However, a wet surface, grease, or dirt can limit the
functionality <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBhagavatula2015BiometricPerceptions">22</a>]</span>. Moreover, there are different kinds of attacks if the victim is not in
the vicinity (like fingerprint spoofing with a 2D/3D print). Such attacks are becoming
easier to carry out, though they still require decent effort <span class="cite">[<a

With FaceID, the user simple picks up the phone and looks at it to unlock it. The chance of another
person unlocking the phone the same way is 1 to 1 Million, according to Apple. However, it is
possible to fool face-unlock systems with different spoofing attacks like using a face

in some cases a simple image of the legimitate user. All the aforementioned systems use a
PIN/Passcode as fallback method that dominates the biometric schemes. De Luca et al. evaluated
the reasons for (not) using biometric authentication on mobile devices in an online survey <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeLuca2015Selfies">76</a>]</span>.
They found that users prioritize usability over security when deciding which unlock mechanism to
use. The respondents who had deactivated Face Unlock mostly did so for usability (read:
interaction times) and reliability reasons. Interestingly, most respondents were aware of the security
trade-off that face recognition entails.
<!--l. 388--><p class="noindent" >Finally, a last example for explicit biometric authentication is <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">voice recognition </span><span class="cite">[<a

Android and Google Home appear to be the only consumer-oriented systems that allow
users to authenticate through their voice <span id="textcolor7"><span

system that uses voice recognition to verify the reset request <span class="cite">[<a

importance to consider embarrassment in the design of natural voice interaction, e.g. in an
office environment. Moreover, &#8220;Both face and voice recognition logins are extremely
situational dependent; [...] speaking into a microphone doesn&#8217;t always work in noisy

<!--l. 392--><p class="noindent" >Implicit authentication is done without prompting or challenging the user, but to continuously
verify his or her identity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XPeisert2013PriciplesAuthentication">251</a>]</span>. One goal is to achieve a more natural interaction, similar to
human-human interaction. Greenstadt and Beal postulate a system that recognizes people like
humans do: &#8220;in most everyday interactions, we recognize people by who they are and how they
behave, rather than by the secrets that they know&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGreenstadt2008CognitiveSecurity">141</a>]</span>. Of course, this excludes situations where
two strangers need to authenticate one another, e.g. at a passport control at the border. A
specific key benefit of successful implicit authentication would be that users do not have to
spend time authenticating explicitly, which can save them a couple of minutes per day
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 395--><p class="noindent" >The way a person walks is one of the features that can be used to recognize them, which humans
can easily do <span class="cite">[<a

traced back to Ailisto et al. who equipped laptop computers with accelerometers <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAilisto2005GaitPatternAccelerometers">7</a>]</span>. They achieved
to identify users this way with an EER of 6.5%. Tamviruzzaman et al. implemented this approach
for mobile phones that at the time (2009) had started to integrate acceleration sensors and
gyroscopes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTamviruzzaman2009ePet">323</a>]</span>. For their &#8220;ePet&#8221; system, they also combined gait patterns with GPS-location
traces, but did not report on a user study. Muaaz and Mayrhofer tackled the issue of device
orientation and achieved an EER of 7.05% in the same study session, but only 18.96% across
multiple sessions. As of now, gait recognition has not been widely adopted, but Android allows the
user to activate &#8220;on body detection&#8221;, which keeps the device unlocked while it is in
motion<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">33</sup></span><a

Reportedly, &#8220;some devices&#8221; can learn the gait pattern and lock the device if they detect a different
walking style. As shown in Table 2.3, gait detection faces a number of problems which are difficult
to overcome.

dynamics, i.e., characteristic typing patterns, can also serve as feature. The first algorithms were

enrolling users might be too bothersome for them, so it should be possible to enroll a user
implicitly. This in turn produces a risk of including data from impostors, too. De Luca
showed that users enter grid-based patterns in a unique way, which can be leveraged for
implicit authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeLuca2012TouchMeOnce">75</a>]</span>. Their second user study focused on this type of unlock
mechanism and, with an average accuracy above 90%, they could decide whether a correctly
entered pattern was actually entered by the legitimate user. Interestingly, at the time of
writing this thesis, De Luca et al.&#8217;s paper is the most-cited CHI publication in the past five

which highlights the impact and potential of this approach. What is more, this is the one of the few
approaches that makes explicit authentication more secure through a second, biometric layer. While
the user models of the aforementioned approaches are created and maintained on the
devices, Nauman and Ali proposed a system architecture that shifts keystroke analysis
to a Trusted Third Party, which authenticates the user <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XNauman2010TOKEN">237</a>]</span>. However, their approach
requires more sophisticated hardware (trusted platform modules), which renders it more
costly.

<!--l. 403--><p class="noindent" >Since all biometric features, if considered independently, can be spoofed in some way (see Table
2.3), approaches to combine multiple features have started to proliferate. Although the idea of
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">multimodal </span>signals for authentication is not particularly new (some implementations were done in
the mid 1990s <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBrunelli1995PersonIdentificationMultipleCues">44</a>]</span>), perhaps the computing power both on the clients and back-ends is now large
enough to handle the input streams. Bigun et al. developed a framework that continues to learn
from multiple signals <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBigun2005CombiningBiometricEvidence">25</a>]</span>, which requires such computing power. Rybinicek et al. presented
a roadmap with obstacles and opportunities <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRybnicek2014RoadmapContinuousAuth">270</a>]</span> that can serve the design of future
multimodal biometric authentication schemes. Google, among other companies, tries to
incorporate the notion of such multimodal implicit authentication in their Smart Lock
solution<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">35</sup></span><a

<!--l. 405--><p class="noindent" >In summary, we can take away that biometric authentication provides many usability benefits like
reduced time spent on authentication and also security enhancements. Though implicit
authentication is unlikely to replace explicit authentication completely, it can still make explicit
schemes more secure as demonstrated by De Luca et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeLuca2012TouchMeOnce">75</a>]</span>. In Section 2.5.4, however, we discuss
why biometrics are still dominated by knowledge based authentication especially in situations

In a multi-factor authentication, the user needs to present multiple credentials
to the systems in whichever form. For instance, the Google 2-step verification
mechanism combines the user-chosen password with a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">one-time password</span>
(OTP)<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">36</sup></span><a

For instance, if users log into their Google account on a computer in an Internet café, they will
receive an OTP on a secondary device, usually in a text message sent to their personal
phone. If no more than two separate channels (&#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">out of band authentication</span>&#8221;, OOBA) are
involved, the scheme is usually referred to as Two-factor authentication or 2FA for short.
Multi-factor authentication aims to prevent impersonation in case an attacker has obtained a
victims primary credential, but not their secondary factor. There were hints to combining
multiple such levels to make authentication more robust already in the late 1970s. Morris
and Thompson mentioned that &#8220;some UNIX systems have instituted what is called an

logging in. If this code is changed periodically, then someone with an old password will
likely be prevented from using it [the system, author&#8217;s note]&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">234</a>]</span>. Moreover, in 1984
Haskett shared an idea about a second level of authentication in 1984 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHaskett1984PassAlgorithms">157</a>]</span>. With the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Pass-Algorithms </span>mechanism, the user first authenticates with their regular credentials and then
proves their identity by responding to a random prompt by completing a pre-shared
procedure. The algorithm is altered by the system administrator and then shared with the
legitimate users, who are supposed to memorize the algorithm rather than a static password.
For instance, the current algorithm could be to use the subsequent letter in the alphabet
based on the challenge: If the challenge is BEL, the user enters CFM as second layer of
authentication. The proposed benefit is that the algorithm is easier to remember and can
still be personalized. Multi-factor authentication has since been widely adopted and
more web services are following. Many banks have the users confirm transactions by a
transaction number (TAN) sent to their phones, although they are already logged in with
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
their banking password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMaurer2011DataTypeWarnings">222</a>]</span>. The primary benefit of multi-factor authentication lies in
the increased confidence of the legitimacy of account actions. In any case, there is a
small usability caveat, because adding more factors leads to longer interactions, which is
not recommendable for secondary tasks like authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. However, the increased
security might in turn improve user experience because it also empowers users to be certain
about interacting with the legitimate party. Attacks on multi-factor authentication are

one-time password to their verified email account or phone. So, in that sense, accessing one&#8217;s
personal email account is the primary authentication factor. After clicking the link or logging in
with the OTP, the link or OTP expires. If implemented at scale, this could allow users to only
memorize the credentials for their email account and log in to all other systems by receiving
magic links. However, the approach is only secure under the assumption that the email
account is well protected. It might be fair to assume that users might underestimate the risk
of relying on magic links. For low-value accounts, though it seems like a viable and
promising solution although trust issues on the user side need to be further addressed

 id="x1-690002.5.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Federated Single Sign On</span></span>
The idea behind single-sign on (SSO) is to allow the user to log into one service and other services
can use this login state without requiring any more explicit authentication actions. Thus, the user
must only remember one set of credentials <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013ProfilePassword">92</a>]</span>. With federated single sign-on, websites can
authenticate users by temporarily redirecting them to a trusted third party <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">35</a>]</span>. The third party
verifies the user&#8217;s identity. Afterwards it signs the authentication request and returns a
text-based token that the client needs to present in future interactions. A historically
successful example is Kerberos <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKohl1993Kerberos">196</a>]</span>. However, SSO approaches did not receive widespread
acceptance for about twenty years <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSun2010BillionKeys">318</a>]</span>. Currently, the OpenID protocol is a state of
the art approach, where user identities are verified in a decentralized approach <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRecordon2006OpenID">260</a>]</span>.
Any web server can act as identity provider, but it is most feasible if trustworthy parties
enable OpenID. Currently, Microsoft, Google and Oracle are among the biggest OpenID
identity providers. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">OAuth </span>is a related protocol, but is not designed as identity proof but to
allow &#8220;relying parties&#8221; to use resources on other websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">35</a>]</span>. For example, a web app
can use OAuth to access profile information on Facebook or publish Twitter messages
on the user&#8217;s behalf. The web app can create a separate user-account with the data it
receives from the OAuth interfaces, and automatically authenticate the user without
further notice. Perhaps this is the reason OAuth is often mistakenly seen as single-sign-on
mechanism.

Modern versions of OAuth/OpenID as well as authentication-as-a-service (AAAS) solutions make
it exceptionally easy to avoid the costs of setting up infrastructures for the simple task of
authenticating users &#8211; a well-defined task since the 1960s. Still, we use passwords basically every
day. So why has it not been possible to replace passwords? Bonneau et al. provide us with an
evaluation framework for web authentication schemes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">35</a>]</span>. In there, they identify three major
aspects where alternative solutions can fall behind passwords: Usability, deployability, and security.
In the following, we summarize the central issues with the most likely candidates to replace
passwords, biometrics and SSO. The argumentation is inspired by Bonneau et al.&#8217;s work, but
extended by a few notable aspects that have become important since they published their paper in
2012.
<!--l. 457--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-710002.5.4"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Usability</span></span>
As we discuss in Chapter 3, the usability of passwords is generally seen as low, mostly because
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
they take long to enter and it is tedious to memorize them. Especially on mobile devices which are
ever more used, this drawback gains weight. But still, the system is easy to learn and users mostly
have it in their own hands to reset passwords. &#8220;Muscle-memory&#8221; reduces the cognitive effort to
recall passwords. Biometrics seem to trump passwords in the usability dimension, because it
is very convenient to authenticate with biometric features. However, there is one fatal
showstopper. It is impossible to manually reset, e.g., a fingerprint after it has been compromised.
It is difficult to communicate to users where their data is stored and that attacks are
unlikely. Moreover, a biometric system makes fuzzy instead of binary decisions. Thus, in
many cases the required probability thresholds are not met and this bad reliability of
sensors and algorithms leads to user frustration. Sharing accounts that are protected with
biometrics also require more elaborate architectures and cumbersome setup. Finally, all
biometric systems have fallback mechanisms, that more often than not rely on passwords,
which leads to new usability problems. SSO also gives users more ease of use, especially
because it reduces the cognitive effort required to authenticate. Still, people&#8217;s trust issues as
well as sub-par mental models appear to outweigh the usability benefits. Another large
usability drawback is the strong lock-in effects established by identity providers. In
summary, both biometrics and federated authentication face insurmountable usability
hurdles.
<!--l. 462--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-720002.5.4"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Deployability</span></span>
Regarding deployability, and thus setup costs, nothing seems to beat passwords. With a plethora of
web-authentication frameworks for different platforms, production-level authentication workflow
can probably be set up in less than a day. It is possible to build user interfaces for password-based
authentication on virtually all systems that take alphanumeric user input. Biometrics often require
hardware sensors, or in the case of behavioral biometrics a powerful back-end suitable for deep
learning and handling massive data streams. It is infeasible to build a fingerprint or iris reader into a
Smart TV, for example. The know-how required to set up artificial intelligence utilized for
authentication has become smaller with the advent of frameworks like Tensorflow, but it is
anything but trivial to do it right on a larger scale. SSO is probably easier to deploy than
biometrics, because there is a negligible cost per user. Frameworks also facilitate set up.
However, switching to SSO can lead to incompatibilities with existing schemes which
increases costs for transition phases and hybrid approaches. In conclusion, passwords are
unbeatable in terms of deployability and the costs it entails to set up password-based
authentication.
<!--l. 466--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-730002.5.4"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Security</span></span>
As discussed in Section 2.2, we can safely assume that if an attacker is dedicated enough to
compromise a password-protected system, they will probably succeed to some degree (depending
on the scale of the attack). Security-wise, biometrics do not really outperform passwords apart
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
from the uniqueness of the &#8220;secret&#8221; and physical observability. However, not only do we
leave our fingerprints in many public places, but also do we have to acknowledge that a
user&#8217;s fingerprint is translated into a digital &#8220;file&#8221;, which can leak. Detecting this attack
is more troublesome than for passwords: A simple Internet search can help users in
finding out whether their password has leaked, but searching for a leaked fingerprint,
let alone other biometric user models, complicates this effort a lot. SSO does in fact
provide more security benefits over passwords than biometrics. The risk of credential
spillage is minimized, and the attack surface for guessing and observation attacks becomes
smaller if only trusted identity providers take care of authentication. Then again, the
responsibility that lies with identity providers is high. Instead of a more disperse attack
landscape, there might be a concentration on these parties if SSO were to become the de facto
standard.

<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2015ImperfectAuthentication">36</a>]</span>. The industry has found ways to work around the drawbacks that passwords certainly entail.
Thus, if passwords are not going away, multi-factor and multi-modal systems may turn out to be the
most promising solution. The challenge is to establish a minimally privacy-sensitive solution that
embraces user-centered design to a higher degree than previous multi-factor/-modal approaches.
Academic research can, according to Bonneau et al., carry out experiments that would potentially
have a detrimental effect on business successes and thus help in pushing viable solutions forward.
As Herley and van Oorshot point out: &#8220;[...] it is time to admit that passwords will be
with us for some time, and moreover, that in many instances they are the best-fit among
currently known solutions.&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>. They propagate a more systematic approach to make
users&#8217; lives easier instead of trying to find the single panacea that replaces passwords
entirely.

<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent" >Morris and Thompson were already concerned with user behavior regarding passwords in 1979
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">234</a>]</span>. They identified that users choose predictable passwords and that this can be leveraged for
attacks. So, they suggested enforcing a certain minimum password length (six characters). At the
time, the users were mostly professionals that received training to operate computers and could thus
also have been trained to pick less predictable passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMaguire2012YouOnlyLiveTwice">217</a>]</span>. But as computers were
introduced to a larger audience, more people were exposed to password authentication.
Naturally, this also induced a growing number of attacks, and it is increasingly difficult
for users to defend themselves against them (see. Section 2.2). Nowadays, password
policies are in place that require not only a minimum of eight characters, but also mandate
mixed-case letters, digits and special symbols to start with. The HCI community noticed
the users&#8217; struggle in the 1990s and that we can &#8211; and should &#8211; design authentication
systems with usability in mind. Perhaps, one of the breaking points where a new school of
thought turned up in the literature was a paper by Adams and Sasse in 1999 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. The
central and novel theme in there was a shift from <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fixing </span>the user to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">acknowledging </span>user
behavior and designing for it. The paper managed to see over 1500 citations as of writing
this.
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >This chapter looks at the literature that mostly came after this seminal work. It discusses the users&#8217;
problems, solutions, feelings, and opinions about using passwords. An essential goal is to give the

hard to come up with viable solutions to make users&#8217; lives less frustrating. To get there, we first
take a brief look at conducting user research with passwords. Hereafter we disseminate
typical coping strategies and solutions. The chapter concludes with a comment on the
discourse that has been going on between the very different schools of thought about
passwords.
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-760003.1"></a>Methodology: Running Password Studies</h3>
<!--l. 31--><p class="noindent" >Before we report on insights about user behavior regarding passwords, we take a look into running
studies that focus on passwords. There are two central aspects that make collecting data particularly
challenging: acting ethically and maintaining high ecological validity of the data. In fact, these two
goals create an area of tension that demands a critical selection of methods. Komanduri et al. note
that &#8220;ideally, password studies would be conducted by collecting data on real passwords created by
real users of a deployed system&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">199</a>]</span>. But this would mean that researchers obtain
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
access to the user accounts that were under investigation. This is ethically questionable
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2012ItsNotStealing">93</a>]</span>. Maybe the researchers themselves are benevolent, but the data is precious and thus
could bring attackers to the scene. Since absolute security can barely be guaranteed, it
is best to avoid that users disclose their actual credentials during a user study to the
researchers.

<!--l. 34--><p class="noindent" >If we cannot collect the users&#8217; real password in its original form, what is the best way to measure,
e.g., cause and effect of novel interventions? There are several alternatives.
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-780003.1.1"></a>Password Creation Tasks</h5>
<!--l. 36--><p class="noindent" >First, one asks participants to create a new password during the user study and stores these
passwords as part of the dataset. This approach resolves the issue of real-world password
disclosure, but introduces a number of problems. Studies should be ethical and thus transparent for
the most part. Hence, the study topic should be known to the participants. However, if participants
know that their passwords are studied, this could induce protective reactions to prevent giving hints
about their real passwords at all. In that case, the participants&#8217; selection strategy does not resemble
much to their real-world behavior and thus the ecological validity of the data is low
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">293</a>]</span>. Although it appears trivial, Fahl et al. suggest that in this scenario, asking the
participants whether they had acted like they normally would is a suitable indicator that helps
in weighting the data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">104</a>]</span>. It is also recommendable to give users a specific scenario
that allows them to immerse themselves in the task. Komanduri et al. argue that having
participants create passwords for fictional email accounts leads to more authentic behavior
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">199</a>]</span>. Some users, however, are less protective and provide one of their real passwords
regardless of the instruction (e.g. 26.5% in Fahl et al.&#8217;s study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">104</a>]</span>). The result is the
same as if the purpose of the study was concealed through an act of deception, which is
occasionally done in psychology studies (for a discussion see <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTai2012Deception">322</a>]</span>). For example, it can
suffice to tell participants a convincing <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">cover story</span>, e.g. that the purpose of the study
is to do a usability test of a social networking site, which also happens to involve an
account setup process (see <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFurnell2017GuidanceCompliance">129</a>]</span>). The data would be ecologically valid because it removes
observer-expectancy and other biases. For the researchers, however, it is extremely difficult to tell
&#8220;real&#8221; passwords and &#8220;new&#8221; passwords apart. Thus, phishing or man in the middle attacks
are sometimes carried out. Haque et al. conducted a laboratory study where they told
participants a cover story to create new accounts for popular websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>. The websites,
however, were re-created by the researchers and stored the passwords on their own servers
instead of performing actual registrations. Egelman et al. used a proxy server to intercept
traffic between the users and a real online portal <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">100</a>]</span>. They also altered the websites to
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
communicate their cover story that the password had expired. This, however, creates an ethical
conundrum, if the dataset is published along with the paper. To allow others to verify
that research is valid, reliable, and generalizable, a published dataset is desirable, but in
Egelman et al. or Haque et al.&#8217;s study this would put real user accounts at risk. Much
in the same vein, sharing research about successfully attacking passwords produces
a similar dilemma. For instance, one can put forward new cracking approaches (e.g.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMarechal2008AdvancesPWCracking">220</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XNarayanan2005FastDictionaryAttacks">236</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSchmidt2013Pitfalls">277</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWeir2009PCFG">362</a>]</span>) that potentially affect common strength metrics (see Section 2.3) &#8211; but
attackers also benefit from this kind of knowledge. From an HCI perspective, one can
also unfold how users select passwords, which allows optimizing cracking efficiency
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">361</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">365</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 48--><p class="noindent" >There are several methods to avoid acting unethically in studies where users are required to create
passwords. First of all, studies involving human subjects are assessed by an Institutional Review
Board (IRB), especially in the United States. This is done to ensure an ethical study design that is
unlikely to cause participants any harm. The IRB might mandate a thorough debriefing of
participants and meticulous documentation of the experiment. In Europe, however, password
studies are less commonly evaluated by an IRB (or authors fail to mention the process in their
papers &#8211; often there are remarks that universities do not have such institutions like in
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">104</a>]</span>). Secondly, one can refrain from releasing the data set, even if user names are
removed. In fact, almost all publications on passwords collected during a user study omit
publishing the corresponding data set. Only the abstract analysis is published and this is a
widely-accepted standard practice, despite the questionable reliability. A rather novel
approach that reduces the likelihood of made-up data relies on the idea of publishing
differentially private data sets. Here, algorithmically generated noise, which is indistinguishable
from the orignal data, is added to the data set to preserve privacy of users. For password
frequency lists, passwords could be mangled and extended by generated passwords that
resemble real ones. Adversaries lack information whether the data is usable as signal or
noise. This way, Blocki et al. managed to release a private frequency list of passwords at
Yahoo that Bonneau had already anonymously analyzed in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">33</a>]</span>. Moreover, instead of
collecting newly generated passwords in plain text, it is possible to store a hashed version.
For instance, Wash et al. had participants install a browser extension that logged all
form submits that included a password field <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">359</a>]</span>. To study reused passwords, they
hashed and sent them over a secure connection to their servers. As long as a slow hash
function and a strong salt are used, this approach is uncritical. However, it merely allows
observing if the hashes match on several sites. Finally, as a last option to collect password
data, researchers can log meta-data instead of passwords. For instance, Von Zezschwitz
et al. used a &#8220;meta password&#8221; that described the participants&#8217; actual passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">350</a>]</span>,
but which was insufficient to reconstruct the original. This can include the number of
characters, upper-/lowercase letters, digits, and even proactive strength estimations. To
collect the data, participants in von Zezschwitz et al.&#8217;s study were provided with an
offline password analysis tool. They entered their password into that and copy-pasted the
result of the analysis into the questionnaire form. If one does not want to examine the
passwords qualities, this approach is absolutely feasible. Florêncio and Herley used a
similar approach for the large-scale data collection with around 500000 participants
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
to avoid running into privacy issues <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">112</a>]</span>. The information transmitted to the logging
server was pseudonymized and contained only meta features. The only downside is
that one cannot run further analyses on the passwords, e.g. if a new strength metric is
considered.
<!--l. 62--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-790003.1.1"></a>Retrospective Self Report</h5>
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >If one wants to refrain from having users create a new password, one can study their past behavior
in different ways. In its simplest form, participants are simply asked to describe how they create
passwords. Stobert &amp; Biddle did this in extensively to create the Password Life Cycle model <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span>
(see Section 3.2). Ur et al. used interviews to find out what users do to make their passwords
stronger <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2015PWCreationLab">341</a>]</span>. Das et al. found out through retrospective interviews that social contacts have a
strong impact on users&#8217; security decisions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDas2014EffectSocialInfluenceSecuritySensitivity">69</a>]</span>. Most commonly, however, typical online surveys
feature a number of questions about personal behavior and attitudes, e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1997MakingPWsSecureAndUsable">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XGaw2006PasswordManagement">133</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#XRiley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo">265</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XShay2010EncounteringPasswordRequirements">294</a>]</span>.
Questions about passwords are easy to implement in a survey and respondents can always choose
how much they want to share. However, one has to stay aware that social desirability
lowers the reliability of the data: since the media also to their part in shaming users
for picking &#8220;bad&#8221; passwords, people may respond dishonestly about their password
behavior. Many people are uncomfortable admitting their password is as simple as 12345.
Another problem results from fading memories. Since most users have more than one
password, it might be difficult for them to recall the correct past behavior. However,
not only password studies suffer from this bias, but any study involving self report in
general.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-800003.1.1"></a>Principles</h5>
<!--l. 66--><p class="noindent" >From user research in USEC of the past decades, Krol et al. derive a set of general principles that
researchers ought to consider when conducting experiments in security and privacy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">204</a>]</span>. We can
integrate password studies in there:
<!--l. 68--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-810003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Primary Task</span></span>
Creating a password should not be the sole task in the study. Instead, participants should achieve a
primary task by authenticating with passwords, e.g. using a new system for a period of time <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBrostoff2000PassfacesEvaluation">42</a>]</span>.
The reasoning behind this principle is that security tasks are secondary tasks and this constraint
needs to be reflected in the experiment. However, re-focusing on a separate primary task is not
always possible, e.g. in surveys.

 id="x1-820003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Realistic Risk</span></span>
Users should be able to realistically estimate the risk for secure interactions. As mentioned above,
Komanduri et al. suggest carefully selecting real-world scenarios to achieve this <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">199</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-830003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">No Priming</span></span>
Whenever human behavior is studied, experiments should avoid influencing and biasing
participants with certain information. This avoids unnatural behavior.

 id="x1-840003.1.1"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Double Blind Experiments</span></span>
If possible, the person carrying out the actual experiment should be involved in the planning
and design of the study. Moreover, the participants should not know the details of the
study, either. On the experimenter side, unconscious bias and influence is mitigated, and
participants also do not know the &#8220;treatment&#8221; they receive (if any). Although this is a
desirable goal, there is little evidence that experiments are usually carried out in this way.

The sources can often be traced back to illegal attacks, which makes the use of such data
somewhat questionable. However, it is a widely accepted method to contrast real-world and
study behavior. The data set that has probably been studied the most originates from a
breach at RockYou, a software development firm specialized at games for social networks.
In 2009, an attacker used an SQL injection to download around 32 Million plain-text
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
passwords. For instance, Veras et al. visualized semantic properties of passwords in this
dataset and highlight the high occurrence of dates in there <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVeras2012VisualizingSemanticsPasswords">345</a>]</span>. Wheeler relied on it to
build the zxcvbn password strength estimation system. More often, though, these data
sets serve as training data for password guessability benchmarks. Weir et al. took the
RockYou passwords to train their PCFG which served as a demonstration that entropy is
not a feasible strength metric for user-chosen passwords. Afterwards, it was integrated
into the training set of PGS. PGS is mostly used to gauge passwords collected through
a user study, e.g. under different policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">291</a>]</span> or interventions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>. In conclusion,
publicly leaked data sets can often serve as ground truth for studies that aim to provide new

To gain the greatest control over experimental parameters, laboratory studies are the
go-to method. Both qualitative and quantitative studies are carried out in the lab,
with a slight surplus of qualitative studies. Among the most common methods, one
finds (semi-)structured interviews (<span class="cite">[<a

in the lab (<span class="cite">[<a

href="#XYan2004PasswordMemorabilitySecurity">376</a>]</span>). Studying short-term recall usually follows a
mental-rotation task (e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKraus2017Emoji">202</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XYang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity">378</a>]</span>). Long-term memorability studies in the lab are
less common, because they require participants to return to the lab, which may be too
bothersome for many. For alternative authentication schemes, this may, however, be the only
option.
<!--l. 98--><p class="noindent" >Although technically it is not a &#8220;lab&#8221; environment, café studies sometimes are closely related to lab

Field studies for password research come in many flavors. <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Online surveys </span>are among the most
common methods used in the field (<span class="cite">[<a

lower cost and comparatively easy implementation. Other advantages like increased sample
size and more diversity in the data speak in favor of online surveys. Survey tools like
surveymonkey.com come in handy, but usually lack seamless integration of interactive
prototypes. If a prototype should be evaluated through a survey, however, one has to
either implement the entire survey structure or redirect participants from the survey
platform to the prototype and back. Surveys are also the weapon of choice if there is
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
an opportune moment that is worth studying. Mazurek et al. took the opportunity to
distribute online questionnaires after a new password policy was introduced at CMU
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMazurek2013Measuring">224</a>]</span>. Fahl et al. profited from a similar situation at Leibniz-University Hannover, and
Renaud et al. could even distribute surveys on the same topic across multiple years in
this way <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">263</a>]</span>. Interestingly, there does not seem to be a special, standardized survey
construct to measure the usability, respectively user experience, of password systems. Other
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) sub-fields more frequently use, for example, the NASA-TLX,
Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS) or AttrakDiff constructs to establish
comparability with other studies. Notable exceptions were reported by Kraus et al., who
used AttrakDiff to evaluate emoji-based authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKraus2017Emoji">202</a>]</span>. The NASA-TLX was
used by Fraune et al., <span class="cite">[<a

href="#XYang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity">378</a>]</span>. Lately, the
Security Behavior Intentions Scale (SeBIS) gains more attention, because it serves as
a self-assessment that can help the interpretation of actions taken during a user study
<span class="cite">[<a

Survey respondents are recruited by paying each one a small amount of money for a valid response.
This way, increasing the sample size is straight-forward, if many users have already signed up on
the platform and are eligible for the Human Intelligence Task (HIT). Workers (known as &#8220;turkers&#8221;)
form an increasingly diverse population <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRoss2010WhoAreTurkers">267</a>]</span>, which is another benefit. In password research, for
instance, Kelley et al.&#8217;s high-impact work on password guessability collected around 12000
passwords using mTurk <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKelley20012GuessAgain">190</a>]</span>. Ur et al. had participants rate the strength and memorability of a
given set of passwords, which allowed them to identify certain misconceptions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>. Mazurek et
al. compared features of passwords created by turkers to real passwords of students and staff at
their university <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMazurek2013Measuring">224</a>]</span>. They take the large similarities of the two data sets as evidence
that passwords created during an mTurk study are a reliable and valid data source, so
there is no urgent need to analyze passwords of a deployed system. Shay wrote a PhD
thesis specifically about evaluating password policies with crowd-sourced data <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2015UsablePoliciesMTurk">289</a>]</span>. In
many cases, e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">291</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>, the primary task is to create a fictional account or
merely a password under certain constraints, which apparently violates Krol et al.&#8217;s
study principles <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">204</a>]</span>. It is especially interesting that most studies are announced as
some kind of password study, probably mandated by IRBs . But Mazurek et al.&#8217;s work
demonstrates that this limitation is bearable. Moreover, studying the long-term memorability of
passwords is facilitated, because participants can be invited to return through an internal,
anonymous messaging system. It is also possible to create more complex study designs with
mTurk, e.g. if multiple device types should be used by the turkers to create passwords
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">229</a>]</span>. Despite the wide range of advantages, there are shortcomings of crowd-sourced
approaches as with any study method. First, turkers are incentivized to complete as many
HITs as possible on the platform to earn money. Thus, completing a survey by providing
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
quick answers without reading the questions could lead to unreliable data. Instructional
Manipulation Checks (IMCs) and attention check questions (ACQs) can mitigate this
problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOppenheimer2009InstructionalManipulationChecks">246</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XPeer2017BeyondTheTurk">250</a>]</span>. Turkers are only paid if the commissioner accepts the HIT as valid,
thus IMCs and attention checks are useful indicators here. Moreover, as of now, the
mTurk platform can only be used in certain countries, e.g. the USA or UK. European
alternatives exist, but are not yet par in terms of user base, response times, and feature set
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XPeer2017BeyondTheTurk">250</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >Aside from surveys, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">diary studies </span>about passwords have proven feasible in the past.
Inglesant and Sasse found out through a diary study that employees struggle with frequent
password changes, which might not have become evident using other study means&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>.
Hayashi and Hong used this method to analyze password re-use across different computers,
services, and organizations <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs">159</a>]</span>. Since password authentication is a secondary task,
keeping a diary of authentication events helps participants provide reliable behavioral data.
However, it requires much effort to continuously stay aware of one&#8217;s actions to log them.
To avoid that participants forget logging and other self-reporting bias <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2017SelfReport">360</a>]</span>, it can be
worthwhile to ask them small questions in situ. This method, known as <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Experience</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Sampling Method (ESM)</span>, requests short responses either in predefined intervals or
when the system detects a relevant event. ESM has not seen much attention in password
studies on the web (Lyastani et al. provide one exception <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLyastani2017ImpactPWMPasswordStrength">216</a>]</span>), but mobile authentication
has been studied with this method <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHarbach2016HardLockLife">155</a>]</span>. Users carry their personal mobile with them
almost all the time, so there is a high chance of successfully receiving the experience
sample. ESM was also found useful for studies about security warnings in browsers
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAkhawe2013AliceInWarningland">8</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XFelt2016RethinkingConnectionSecurityIndicators">107</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Perhaps, ESM is underused for password studies, because it is possible to automatically detect such
events and survey the participants before and/or after the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">automatic data collection</span>. Florêncio and
Herley conducted one of the largest studies to date on password habits with this method <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">112</a>]</span>.
Their intention was to find out among other things A) how often people type passwords, B) how
many sites share a password C) how many distinct passwords a user has, and D) how the
strong the passwords are. Working at Microsoft, they were granted to utilize the Windows
Live Toolbar for Internet Explorer to collect in-the-wild data from up to 500,000 users
during three months of running the collection. They conceived the method of protected
password lists (PPL) to avoid intruding into people&#8217;s privacy &#8211; a kind of meta description of
passwords which is sent to the logging server instead of the original password. It was thus not
possible to trace the incoming data back to a specific user. However, there are a number of
limitations this method. The authors point out that the anonymity of the incoming data-stream
might have resulted in over-counting of entries. Also, it was not measured how long the
actual password entries takes. If users only used regular dictionary words without any
modification as their passwords, the key logging module of the toolbar would have recorded
a password reuse event (PRE) every time the user entered that word &#8211; also in regular
online communication. Nevertheless, the fact that users are typically focused on their
primary tasks, background logging helps to collect unbiased data with high ecological
validity.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 121--><p class="noindent" >A final option to study passwords in the field is to collect and analyze them in an already
deployed system (<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">in-situ evaluation</span>), which would be the ideal data source, according to
Komanduri et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">199</a>]</span>. Brostoff and Sasse utilized a coursework system to evaluate
Passfaces as alternative to passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBrostoff2000PassfacesEvaluation">42</a>]</span>. Similarly, Renaud et al. used a coursework
tool to evaluate the effectiveness of different password nudges <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">263</a>]</span>. Mazurek et al.
gained access to passwords of their University&#8217;s Single-Sign On (SSO) and were able
to break down differences in password selection behavior by departments. As one of
the few exceptions from the industry, Bonneau analyzed a private password data set at
Yahoo <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ScienceOfGuessing">33</a>]</span> and Amazon <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">38</a>]</span>. The data is highly ecologically valid and diverse if it
originates from a real product or service. However, if interventions are implemented as
part of a study, this might have negative consequences for both the service provider
and the users. For instance, in an A/B setting one intervention to influence password
selection might in fact lead to weaker passwords and put users at risk. Each user is a critical
potential source of revenue for service providers, so tampering with the sign-up procedure
might lead to higher bounce rates and consequently financial loss. High stakes like this
make it difficult for researchers to convince stakeholders to cooperate on a study. In
conclusion, it is unsurprising to see only rare instances of password studies carried out
with deployed systems in public environments, although the insights gained might be
invaluable.

<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" >Using one of the study methods above is the first step to get closer to answering the research
methods. However, to get the full picture of the studied phenomenon, a <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">triangulated</span>
approach appears to be the only option. For example, Wash et al. combined a survey
with log analyses to study password reuse and self-report issues <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">359</a>]</span>. A multi-tiered
approach like in Von Zezschwitz et al.&#8217;s study helps to identify themes first (formative
stage) and quantify them later (summative stage) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2014HoneyIShrunkTheKeys">351</a>]</span>. Similarly, Huh et al. were able to
refine their concept of system-initiate user-replaceable passwords through triangulation
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHuha2015UserReplaceablePasswords">170</a>]</span>. Adams and Sasse conducted qualitative interviews to follow up web survey results
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. If constraints allow for only one method, it is recommendable to consider how to
collect both quantitative and qualitative data points. For instance, in online surveys that
evaluate a novel password intervention, it is always feasible to collect quantitative metrics
(e.g. usability and password strength) and qualitative data (reasoning, explanations,
feedback) to put study results into context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. Those eager to find a starting point for
Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) experiments probably find essential aspects in
Krol et al.&#8217;s principles for experimental design <span class="cite">[<a

can be drawn on to fulfill those principles, which is aimed at in Part II and III of this

<!--l. 143--><p class="noindent" >Passwords are the cornerstone of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">knowledge-based </span>authentication. And although &#8220;knowledge&#8221; can
be stored inside and retrieved from computers, it is still a human capability to learn things and
hereafter &#8220;know&#8221; them. So, humans are a large factor in the equation of knowledge-based
authentication. Their actions and behavior to gain knowledge on passwords deserve to be studied in
detail.
<!--l. 146--><p class="noindent" >Some cybersecurity researchers started blaming system failures and vulnerabilities on users. For
instance, Feldmeier et al. stated in 1990: &#8220;The main weakness in any password system is that users
often choose easily guessable passwords: English words, names, trivial extensions to English
words, etc., because they are easy to remember&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFeldmeier1990UnixPasswordSecurity">105</a>]</span>. It quickly became a dictum that users were
the &#8220;weakest link&#8221; in the figurative authentication chain <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2001WeakestLink">272</a>]</span>. However, since the late
1990s, the HCI advocates that systems take into account user capabilities and not the
other way around <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">273</a>]</span>. Adams and Sasse postulated in 1999 that service providers
acknowledge that &#8220;users are not the enemy&#8221;, which is one of the most influential position
papers on the topic <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>]</span>. In that paper, they provide four central challenges in password
authentication that users face: 1) Users have to deal with multiple passwords, 2) users do not
intuitively create strong passwords 3) password procedures and work practices might
conflict and 4) users have a sub-par understanding of organizational security issues.
Those challenges are often too hard to come by in everyday password authentication
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDourish2004UserStrategiesEveryday">88</a>]</span>. As a consequence, users develop coping strategies to reduce their task load. This
early framework has since been fed with numerous research studies and is still valid
today.
<!--l. 153--><p class="noindent" >Stobert and Biddle formalized user challenges and behavior in the &#8220;Password Life Cycle&#8221; (see
Figure 3.1), which they arrived at through qualitative interviews and coding the participants&#8217;
responses <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span>. It starts out with the challenge to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">choose a password</span>. Coping strategies at this
point revolve around reducing effort, e.g. to memorize the password. Including personal or
personally meaningful information comes natural to users. Others include pointers to the time they
created it, or word-associations about the website-content. Mnemonics are found with some users,
especially those aiming to secure their account. In essence, however, users often memorize their
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">coping strategy</span>, to recall their password. Consistent strategies reduce the effort effectively. Even if
complex policies mandate a change to the first-choice password, users have a go-to strategy to deal
with this situation, e.g. by appending a preferred symbol. When people create passwords, the
most common action is to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">reuse an old password</span>. This is not always possible, so users
need to maintain and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">commit to </span>a number of passwords. Hayashi et al. observed in a
diary study that users categorize accounts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs">159</a>]</span> in different ways. There is also a mix of
different password retrieval methods at the commitment stage. A survey in 2017 from
Pew Research Center with N=926 participants found that the vast majority commits
to their passwords by memorizing them in their heads (preferred strategy for 65% of
the respondents) or by noting down the password (49% do this, and it is the preferred
strategy for 18%) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">244</a>]</span>. Some respondents also either saved passwords in their browser
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
(18%) or used a dedicated password manager (12%), but this appears to be a negligible
go-to strategy (5% of the respondents). Once the user has committed to a password,
they <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">live with it</span>, even if it produces difficulties in certain situations. For instance, the
question &#8220;when is it time to change the password?&#8221; falls into that stage of the cycle. Finally,
if passwords are not actively used on a regular basis, or were recently changed, it is
very foreseeable that users <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">forget their passwords</span>. The password reset mechanism
helps users cope in this situation. The two options at this point are to either create a
completely new password (which increases the likelihood of forgetting it), or to reuse
one (which potentially reduces the number of unique passwords). Then the cycle starts
over. In the following we shed light on the actions and consequences at the different
stages.

<!--l. 199--><p class="noindent" >Another reason for the prevalence of weak passwords lies in incorrect <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mental models</span>. Mental
models are descriptions of how humans make sense of functions and system states <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">348</a>]</span>. Some
users who aim to create stronger passwords still fail because their strategies to accomplish the task
are predictable. Gaw et al. found that mangling is predictable <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGaw2005ReuseRecycle">132</a>]</span>. Ur et al. pointed out that users
understand a great deal of password security, but their modification behavior of existing passwords
is sub-par <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2015PWCreationLab">341</a>]</span>. Moreover, they provide evidence that users succeed to identify strong passwords,
but only certain characteristics are misleading <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>. For instance, including digits yielded
significantly higher subjective strength ratings, but does not always effectively improve strength.
What is more is that participants in their study showed a skewed understanding of password
attacks. For instance, 34% of respondents thought that a strong password needs to withstand at
least 50 guesses by an attacker. Therefore, trying to fend off a dictionary attack might
be futile if users do not know that attackers attempt to crack the password trillions of
times. Ur et al. conclude that feedback should thus inform users about attack scenarios
which helps them assess the risk more realistically. Although it is sometimes argued
that passphrases, i.e. a combination of multiple dictionary words, are often as secure as
passwords from a richer character set <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">293</a>]</span>, users fail to create strong passphrases, too.
Bonneau studied the linguistic properties of passphrases at Amazon and noted that an
attacker could easily model user behavior to effectively crack passphrases <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">38</a>]</span>. So, in
other words, the mental model &#8220;passphrase = secure&#8221; is also wrong and problematic.
Finally, mental models also play a role for risk assessment in organizations. In many
cases, employees underestimate the security threat that companies face day to day, which
leads to insecure password practices <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1999UsersEnemy">3</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">364</a>]</span>. To summarize this point, users fail to
create strong passwords, because in many cases <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">erroneous mental models </span>stand in the
way.
<!--l. 204--><p class="noindent" >What the media often call &#8220;laziness&#8221; and &#8220;stupidity&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVolkamer2013MentalModels">348</a>]</span>, may in fact be the rational
rejection of password security. Riley pointed out that users are well aware of &#8220;better&#8221;
behavior, but they often ignore it by choice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRiley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo">265</a>]</span>. Florêncio et al. argue that this behavior
is absolutely rational, because some accounts do not require strong protection and it
would be impossible for users to follow all security advice given by experts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">117</a>]</span>. A case
example of an account that may be valuable for some, but not for others is LinkedIn.
The social-media platform which is focused on business connections suffered a severe
data breach in 2012, but only became aware of a much larger leakage in 2016. Many
hashed passwords had leaked and thus the affected users were prompted to reset their
passwords. Huh et al. investigated the reasons (not) to reset the password and in many
instances, people said that they do not use the service very often, did not want to, or were not
really concerned about the risks <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHuh2017TooBusy">169</a>]</span>. Ur et al.&#8217;s results also indicate that users do know
in theory what makes a strong password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>. A survey commissioned by LastPass
reported that one group of users often do not care about their accounts if they are not
meaningful to them <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked">207</a>]</span>, while the other group is overly careful, but there does not
appear to be a &#8220;just fine&#8221; area of behavior. The first group may believe that stronger
passwords do not accomplish protection anyhow <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007DoStrongWebPasswords">115</a>]</span>. Herley and Pieters argue that it is also
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
difficult to objectively falsify claims about security precautions, which would help to
debunk unjustified security advice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. So, in essence, users choose weak passwords
because they think <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">the account is unimportant </span>and therefore it is fine to ignore security
advice.
<!--l. 208--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, the literature lists a few other reasons that lead to weak passwords. Groß et al. looked at the
association between cognitive depletion and selection behavior <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGross2016EffectCognitiveEffort">143</a>]</span>. They reach the conclusion
that if cognitively challenging tasks precede password selection, the resulting passwords tend to get
weaker. Von Zezschwitz et al. point out that a user&#8217;s first passwords are created probably in teenage
years when security precautions might be much less evident to people <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">350</a>]</span>. For important
accounts, these early passwords are modified, but still persist for many years after they were first
committed to. Mobile phones are another factor that steadily gains more importance. Under
lab conditions, Yang et al. found that participants included more lowercase letters in
passwords, if they created them on a smartphone <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYang2014EntryAffectsPasswordSecurity">378</a>]</span>. Von Zezschwitz et al. corroborate the
findings and argue that passwords created on smartphones are much less diverse than their
desktop-counterparts, because they are shorter and contain mostly lowercase letters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2014HoneyIShrunkTheKeys">351</a>]</span>.
Two years later, Melicher et al. studied the interoperability of passwords on different
platforms <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">229</a>]</span>. Interestingly, the passwords created on mobiles were only marginally
weaker than those created on a desktop, but had more potential to lead to user frustration,
especially if requirements were too bothersome. The individual keyboard on a mobile
influences frustration levels, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHaque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword">153</a>]</span>. In summary, contextual factors like cognitive
depletion and the device used during password creation have a notable impact on password
strength.
<!--l. 216--><p class="noindent" >We thus identify four main themes from related work that cause weak passwords: 1) Weak
passwords are more memorable. 2) Hard-to-change mental models prevent the creation of stronger
passwords. 3) In many situations, users rationally reject the effort to create a strong password. 4)
Contextual factors notably influence selection strategies. In the following, we dissect another
coping strategy, which is potentially even riskier than selecting weak passwords: password
reuse.
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-930003.2.2"></a>Password Reuse</h4>
<!--l. 220--><p class="noindent" >The primary reason for password reuse is the mere fact that users create new accounts on a regular
basis, and it is logical to make sure to be able to log in later by choosing a secret they already
know. &#8220;Password overload&#8221; essentially frames the problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYang2016MnemonicSentenceBased">377</a>]</span>. &#8220;Memory interference&#8221;
postulates reuse as a coping strategy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XChiasson2009InterferencesGraphical">53</a>]</span>. In 2007, Florêncio and Herley conducted a
large-scale study that empirically showed the challenges and coping strategies regarding
this overload&#x00A0;<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">112</a>]</span>: Users of the Windows Live Toolbar had 6.5 distinct passwords,
each of which was used for 3.9 different websites. During the data collection period,
users logged into 25 accounts on a regular basis, and typed around 8 passwords per
day. Although keeping track of the multitude of username-password combinations is
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
a tough challenge, most users still rely on their memory instead of other tools <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">244</a>]</span>.
Users realize the challenge is hard, but Woods et al. argue that users underestimate their
capabilities when it comes to memorizing passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWoods2018TooManyPasswords">373</a>]</span>. Consequently, many people do
not try to create a richer portfolio of passwords than the numbers from the 2007 study
showed. More recent numbers show that between 39% <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">244</a>]</span> and 76% <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCSID2012PasswordHabits">65</a>]</span> of users
rely on reuse as coping strategy. Since social desirability bias could lead to dishonest
survey responses, the &#8220;dark figure&#8221; might even be higher, because, as Inglesant and Sasse
put it, &#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Users see &#8216;good&#8217; passwords (that are memorable and conform to the policy)</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">as a &#8216;resource&#8217;, which they continue to use for new applications even if the original</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">use is no longer allowed.</span>&#8221; (<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>). What is more is that the user-name is part of the
authentication process, and users pick different aliases, pseudonyms, emails for different accounts
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHayashi2011DiaryStudyPWs">159</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 222--><p class="noindent" >All this is consequential for the overall online security of an individual. The more a user relies
on reuse passwords, the more severe phishing attacks and data breaches become. The
metaphorical &#8220;Domino Effect&#8221; describes the situation after a breach: When an attacker obtains a
password form one user&#8217;s account, all the other accounts might fall with it <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XIves2004DominoEffectReuse">173</a>]</span>. It&#8217;s
enough to know even only one low-value password to crack a large part of high-value
passwords via predictable mangling rules <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDas2014TangledWeb">68</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>. Still, password reuse is difficult
to mitigate, so Ives argues to look into understanding the specific approaches better
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XIves2004DominoEffectReuse">173</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 226--><p class="noindent" >One such approach is to categorize passwords by different criteria. Here, we can borrow the
&#8220;Mental Accounting&#8221; theory from Behavioral Economics to describe users&#8217; risk assessments.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStockinger2015TowardsBE">316</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XThaler2004">326</a>]</span>. Users put their passwords into mental accounts that help them recall them later. Wash
et al. argues that frequently entered credentials are reused more likely than seldom used ones <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">359</a>]</span>.
However, interviewees in Stobert and Biddle&#8217;s study reported the opposite behavior
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span>. Florêncio and Herley noticed that strong passwords (in terms of entropy) are
less frequently reused than weak passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2007LargeScaleStudyPasswordHabits">112</a>]</span>. Here again, Wash et al. observed the
opposite: participants in their study prioritized stronger passwords as reuse candidates
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">359</a>]</span>. If the latter is true, than this is another indicator for problematic mental models
regarding risk assessment: users try to follow security advice and prefer strength over
uniquenessm which is typically also advised. Nonetheless, strategies (or at least results) appear
to fluctuate throughout the years. Many users cluster their secrets regarding the usage
purpose <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>]</span>, e.g. banking, social media, communication, shopping, etc. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XNotoatmodjo2007ExploringWeakestLink">242</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XStobert2014PWMThatDoesntRemember">311</a>]</span>.
Bailey et al., however, argue that users do not really respect the usage purpose, but the
value, importance, and meaningfulness of the account <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBailey2014StatisticsReuse">18</a>]</span>. In that sense, users do not
appear to care if the password ought to protect financial information if the website does
not mean much to them. Radke et al. found users in their diary study tended to create
unique passwords for important accounts, and reuse passwords for less important ones
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRadke2013WhoDecides">257</a>]</span>. Still, probably all users have a &#8220;go-to password&#8221; that is tried first for an account
whose value is uncertain in the beginning <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span>. If password requirements disallow the
preferred choice, the go-to password might not work anymore. Typically, users either
pick another password from their portfolio in that situation, or they mangle their first
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
choice until all requirements are met. As we show in Chapter <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>, neither strategy is
necessary if the go-to-password shows certain features. But in case the policy mandates a
change, Gaw and Felten have laid out that user-chosen mangling strategies are predictable,
too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGaw2006PasswordManagement">133</a>]</span>. Besides, policies might not be the only reason for password modifications.
Over time, users sometimes are exposed to new security advice or other realizations that
their previous password strategy is generally considered weak <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">350</a>]</span>. Taking the current
(already memorized) credentials, and applying the recommendations to them is an obvious
choice.
<!--l. 237--><p class="noindent" >Florêncio et al. describe reuse, categorization, memorable passwords, and mangling as &#8220;finite
effort&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">117</a>]</span>. They meticulously lay out that password these strategies are not only common, but
inevitable and necessary. Even experts in cybersecurity show similar patterns <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLoutfi2015PasswordsOtherSideOfTheFence">215</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XStobert2015ExpertPassword">313</a>]</span>. The
major difference between mainstream users and experts is that the latter are more articulate and
considerate about their coping strategies.
<!--l. 242--><p class="noindent" >In conclusion, we can hang on to the idea that password reuse is a necessary coping strategy.
Zhang-Kennedy et al. motivate that it is not even &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;risky&#8221; per se <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">385</a>]</span>. The
challenge is to do it &#8220;right&#8221;. However, motivating users to alter this particular aspect is
comparable to motivating a smoker to quit their guilty pleasure: Abandoning reuse does not
show a visible immediate pay-off (nor does quitting smoking). In many cases, it does
not cause harm, even though 16% of US-Americans have experiences someone else
taking over their accounts <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 247--><p class="noindent" >To avoid memory interference, many users resort to writing down their passwords. In its simplest
form, a sheet of paper that holds user name and password suffices. Roughly half the users
reportedly do this <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">244</a>]</span>. Many users also use a dedicated note-book that keeps their passwords
in one place <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKothari2017PasswordLogbooks">201</a>]</span>. Interestingly, some manufacturers offer &#8220;password-logbooks&#8221; to
help users organize their credentials. Kothari et al. collected customer reviews about the
ten most reviewed logbooks and analyzed their content to derive a mental model of
password security <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKothari2017PasswordLogbooks">201</a>]</span>. They were surprised how many people apparently use one of
those logbooks and what their motivations are. For instance, customers often loved the
inconspicuousness of the books and gave them away as presents. Age-related memorability
challenges were also a central theme. Many people acknowledged the security risks but were
unsure if a piece of software would be more secure than the book. Password logbooks
can become a single point-of-failure. Digital files on the computer are often almost as
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
accessible to local attackers (friends / spouses). In the workplace, writing passwords down on
sticky notes <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 250--><p class="noindent" >Using a PWM is a more sophisticated way of &#8220;externalizing&#8221; passwords. In essence, a password
manager is a digital representation of the &#8220;logbooks&#8221; described above, but comes with many helpful
extra features, like easy access, encryption with a master password etc. A plethora of services and
tools exist in different flavors (e.g. built into browsers, third party programs, browser
extensions, free vs. premium, cloud-based vs. local). Notable representatives include LastPass
(freemium/subscription), 1Password (premium/subscription), KeePassX (free, one-off payment for
apps), and Dashlane (freemium/subscription). Arias-Cabarcos et al. evaluated popular PWMs and
suggest that Dashlane provides the the most feasible usability/security trade-off <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAriasCabarcos2016ComparingPWM">13</a>]</span>. However,
surveys have often revealed the low adoption rate of password managers <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">244</a>]</span>, mostly because
users feel secure enough with their current management habits, or due to financial hurdles and
distrust <span class="cite">[<a

<!--l. 253--><p class="noindent" >Lyastani et al. recently investigated the impact of using a PWM on password strength and reuse
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLyastani2017ImpactPWMPasswordStrength">216</a>]</span>. Those PWMs which included a generator had a positive effect on overall password strength
and diversity in the large sample studied in-situ. But existing user strategies thwarted a boost in
security, e.g. if a built-in PWM is solely used to store reused passwords. Users often benefit from
automatically filled login-forms and do not have to type their passwords anymore, which is a huge
usability plus. Autofill moreover mitigates most phishing attacks, because the PWM verifies
the domain. As with analog notepads, PWMs are a single point of failure, in case the
master password is weak. This is one of the few instances in which a strong password is
recommended without restrictions. Password managers constitute a honey pot for attackers, who
exploit security vulnerabilities of the software to gain access to user passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012ReplacePasswords">35</a>]</span>. The
situation is aggravated if passwords are synced to the manufacturer&#8217;s cloud storage,
although this is recommended by Yee to enable seamless availability <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYee2006Passpet">380</a>]</span>. To summarize,
password managers are a feasible solution for many users, but adoption rates are still fairly
low.

<!--l. 256--><p class="noindent" >Coping with a forgotten password shows more particularities of user behavior. If offered by service
providers, the easiest way to handle the situation is to obtain a password reset link via email and
create a new password. In the past, password resets had been responsible for a large portion of
helpdesk calls <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2001WeakestLink">272</a>]</span>, but self-service procedures have successfully mitigated the issue. Users tend
to reuse passwords or mangle an old password when they forget and reset their credentials <span class="cite">[<a

some cases, however, password reset links are replaced by personal knowledge questions <span class="cite">[<a

These often present a great risk to user accounts because of the statistical probability
involved (e.g. &#8220;what was the make of your first car&#8221; has a predictable distribution), or the
information is findable on social networks (e.g. &#8220;what is your city of birth&#8221;). Consequently, a
strong primary password can be dominated by a weak fallback question and voids user
efforts to secure their account. Perhaps the only strategy to maximize security within this
scheme is to provide bogus answers to secret questions to fend-off statistical attacks

with one&#8217;s own reuse strategy and pick strong passwords in a select number of cases,
e.g. master passwords for PWMs or central hubs like email accounts. In the following,

more accessible to them and relieve the tensions between usability and security at the same time.
Although systems can be changed in many ways, it is difficult to change the user. If the user needs

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">3.3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-990003.3.1"></a>Password Composition Policies</h4>
<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" >Combating weak passwords has received the most attention from research and practice. The idea of
enforcing certain password requriments dates back to the 1970s, i.e. the early days of cybersecurity.
Morris and Thompson acknowledged password authentication is inherently flawed in terms of
usability. They suggested to make users either choose longer passwords, or systematically
assign passwords to them to <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMorris1979PasswordSecurity">234</a>]</span>. At the time, guessing attacks were not as powerful
as they are today and it was obvious to shift responsibility to users <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFeldmeier1990UnixPasswordSecurity">105</a>]</span>. When the
Electronic Authentication guideline was published by NIST, password composition policies
became the de-facto standard in attempting to make users select stronger passwords.
The NIST guideline suggested passwords be at least eight characters long, include at
least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one digit, and one special symbol <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBurr2004NISTEntropy">48</a>]</span>.
Moreover, passwords may not be taken from a dictionary with common words and not be
permutations of the username. By looking at entropy estimates, it was argued that the
resulting passwords would achieve at least 30 bits of entropy. Interestingly, this was
not the only specification for policies. The guideline specifically says that passwords
could also be graded with some other metric and be rejected based on their estimated
entropy. At the time, there was not much evidence that user-selected passwords created
under the NIST-policy were in fact strong, which set of a number of research studies,
and made password composition policies one of the most studied topics in password
security.
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" >Proctor et al. found in 2002 that certain &#8220;proactive password restrictions&#8221; lead to stronger
passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XProctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions">255</a>]</span>. In two laboratory experiments, they had participants create a new password for a
university account. The policies differed in the required minimum length (five and eight) and
additional requirements like upper-/lowercase letters and digits. In the first experiment, where
passwords only had to be five characters long, introducing the additional requirements had a greater
effect on strength than in the eight-character-minimum condition. Increasing the minimum length
by three characters already had a stronger effect. Interestingly, they concluded &#8220;Perhaps the most
important message of this study is that restrictions on user-generated passwords may not
accomplish their intended goals.&#8221; Proctor et al.&#8217;s early hypothesis that policies are more
or less ineffective is particularly surprising because in the fifteen years that followed,
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
many research papers were written about such restrictions and many of them ultimately
came to similar conclusions. In the following some of the most influential works are
summarized.
<!--l. 281--><p class="noindent" >Inglesant and Sasse report on a diary study of password policies in corporate contexts <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>]</span>. They
reached the disillusioning conclusion that password policies reduce employees&#8217; productivity. Once
they found a password that fulfilled the policy, participants used it as a resource to turn to when
creating more accounts. Similarly, Komanduri found that users barely go beyond the minimum
requirements of policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2011OfPasswordsAndPeople">199</a>]</span>, but some policies yield better results than others. Weir et al.
categorize policies into &#8220;explicit&#8221; and &#8220;implicit&#8221; policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeir2010MetricsPolicies">361</a>]</span>, where explicit policies have
predefined rules about the password structure like the NIST policies which is explicitly based on
lowercase, uppercase, digits, symbols (LUDS) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">365</a>]</span>. On the other hand, implicit policies focus on
strength estimation and are somewhat more volatile and intransparent to the users. For
instance, if the policy uses a blacklist of words, that are disallowed, the list is usually not
displayed to users up front. The blacklist only becomes visible after the first attempt is made.
Moreover, they used subsets of the RockYou data set that fulfilled the NIST policy. Here,
Weir et al. provided early pointers that many of those passwords can be easily cracked,
too.
<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" >Thus, the logical next step was to find replacements for the NIST policy with better usability and
security. First attempts to find it were of theoretical nature. Blocki et al. modeled an &#8220;optimal&#8221;
policy as algorithmically solvable challenge <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBlocki2013OptimizingPasswordPolicies">29</a>]</span>, which was proposed by Shay <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2009PolicySimulation">290</a>]</span>. However,
while theoretically sound, empirical evidence was necessary to quantify the effects on user
behavior.

href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">291</a>]</span>:
Basic policies that only mandate a certain length (e.g. basic12), character-class centric policies that
require between 2 and 4 different character classes and a given length (e.g. 3class12), policies
requiring phrase-like syntax and a given length (e.g. 2word16), and complex policies that have
more than 4 specific requirements (comp8). Table 3.2 illustrates the specific differences as found in
the taxonomy. In multiple studies they compared the guessability of passwords under different
policies. They found that a 3class16 policy produced the least guessable passwords, while basic12
yielded the highest cracking success rates. For a limited attacker, who can make up to <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">6</span> guesses,
basic16 and basic20 performed poorly, but they fared well at the cut-off threshold of
<span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">14</span>. The NIST-policy (comp8) performed well up to <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">6</span> guesses, but almost as many
passwords had been cracked after <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">14</span> guesses as for the basic12 policy. This refutes the
postulation that character diversity automatically leads to stronger passwords when users
select them. Shay et al. point out that 28% in the comp8 condition only fulfilled the
criteria by adding an exclamation mark &#8220;!&#8221; at the end, which is corroborated by Ur et al.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2015PWCreationLab">341</a>]</span>. So, as hypothesized, policies significantly influence the strength of user-generated
passwords. In terms of usability, there are signficant differences, too. Shay et al. examined
typical usability metrics, as well as user ratings. basic12 passwords were the easiest to
create, fastest to type and easiest to remember. Interestingly, the 3class12 policy was
comparable in all dimensions. All in all, basic16, 3class12, and 2word16 seem like the
&#8220;winners&#8221; in terms of security and usability, but 2word16 passwords have high beta
guess rates <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>]</span>. To combat this, Shay et al. suggest blacklisting specific sub-strings

<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XInglesant2010TrueCostOfUnusablePolicies">172</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XChiasson2015QuantifyingExpiration">54</a>]</span>. Forcing users to reset their users in predefined intervals was argued to mitigate
threats arising from data breaches. If password leaks go unnoticed, at least they expire at
regular points. For users, an expiration policy drastically increases password overload and
memory interference, for which the typical coping strategies (see Section 3.2) prevail:
an expired &#8220;password1&#8221; quickly is reset to &#8220;password2&#8221; and so forth <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XZhang2010PasswordExpiration">384</a>]</span>. Thus, it
has been argued that expiration is ineffective and causes users too much effort without
graspable security benefits. Chiasson et al. set out to quantify the benefits of expiration
but their mathematical model strongly indicated that the benefits are &#8220;marginal at best&#8221;
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XChiasson2015QuantifyingExpiration">54</a>]</span>. If expiration is not enforced, security experts often advise users to change their
password often. Zhang-Kennedy et al. reframe this rule to &#8220;change your password well&#8221;
<span class="cite">[<a

compromised.

the same password characteristics <span class="cite">[<a

different features for &#8220;security reasons&#8221;, because they might wonder who is right. Florêncio
and Herley compared policies of high-traffic websites and public institutions, mostly
universities <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">113</a>]</span>. Surprisingly, the most influential companies enforce some of the
loosest policies. The researchers argue that decisions in these companies are not only
influenced by security officers (who evangelize password strength and expiration) but also
by user experience experts (who point out the usability issues). In public institutions,
security advisors outnumber human-factors experts, which is why policies represent
an &#8220;overshoot&#8221; of security there, imposing considerable nuisance at marginal security
benefits.

We summarized common advice and the characteristics of &#8220;bad passwords&#8221; in Section 2.4. The
original NIST guideline also read more like a &#8220;how to&#8221; than a dictum for policies, although it was
translated into policies after all. Sasse et al. expressed doubts about the effectiveness of user
education, because it &#8220;will only work if users are motivated&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2001WeakestLink">272</a>]</span>. We know by now that
security is a secondary goal, and thus it is unlikely that people are motivated to educate
themselves about it. Therefore, we have to focus on the restriction &#8220;if users are motivated&#8221; and
present advice effectively in this opportune moment. Security can become the primary
task, or on-par with the primary task. For instance, the moment users adopt a password
manager and have to set-up their master password, they not only want to simplify password
management, but also ensure that their central hub is safeguarded against attacks. Some
web-accounts are of great value and users are potentially more open to receive support to secure
those.
<!--l. 325--><p class="noindent" >We can identify four central problems with password advice. 1) There is no consensus about
adequate password strength, because it always depends on the attack model. Thus, any
guideline should differentiate between threat models and brief the users about them.
However, this is rarely done in practice and most advice is opinionated <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2015Counterfactuals">164</a>]</span>. Besides,
password advice becomes outdated if new threat models prevail. 2) Reading a guide does not
necessarily translate into action. Herley says users are rational in rejecting advice if it
entails too much effort <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2009SoLongThanksExternalities">162</a>]</span>. Forget et al. empirically showed that advice can lead to
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
insecure behavior, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2007HelpingUsers">123</a>]</span>. 3) Users misread password advice. Ur et al. argue that users
misconstrue a statement like &#8220;adding digits, upper-case letters, lower-case letters and
symbols add to the strength of the passwords&#8221; to &#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">all </span>passwords with digits, upper and
lower case letters, and symbols are strong&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>. Heterogeneous composition policies,
and feedback can influence mental models, too. Forget et al. argue that one needs to
understand users&#8217; mental models of authentication first, before they can be effectively
instructed <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2007HelpingUsers">123</a>]</span>. 4) Lastly, if password advice achieves to change user behavior on a larger
scale, password guessing attacks will be modeled around the recommendations, too
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>. Thus, in the long run, advice needs to be revised because attacks become too
efficient.
<!--l. 338--><p class="noindent" >To conclude, one needs to stay realistic about what can be achieved with password advice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2016CommACM">118</a>]</span>.
Zhang-Kennedy et al. provide this realistic view on advice <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">385</a>]</span>. They revised the &#8220;character
diversity&#8221; recommendation and suggest not using common passwords, predictable substitutions, or
dictionary words. However, we still face the problem of communicating to users what &#8220;common&#8221;
passwords and &#8220;predictable substitutions&#8221; are. Zhang-Kennedy et al. propose users should
come up with original mnemonics, which is a special kind of advice discussed in the
following.

<!--l. 344--><p class="noindent" >Many researchers have proposed techniques and algorithms to help users create memorable and
strong passwords. Haskett put forward PassAlgorithms <span class="cite">[<a

respond to a challenge rather than a static password.

 id="x1-1020003.3.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Mnemonics and Training</span></span>
Barton and Barton were likely the first to propose mangling strategies in this context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBarton1984Mangling">19</a>]</span>. For
instance, they suggested to use sentence-based mnemonics and mentally connect passwords to
different cities. For Paris, a sentence like &#8220;I love Paris in the Springtime&#8221; would translate into
&#8220;IlPitS&#8221;. This work was seminal and some of its techniques persist in password recommendations
today. Yan et al. empirically showed the benefits in terms of memorability and security of the
resulting passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYan2004PasswordMemorabilitySecurity">376</a>]</span>. However, Forget et al. observed that telling participants to generate
phrase-based passwords can be misinterpreted and more guidance is necessary to achieve benefits
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2007HelpingUsers">123</a>]</span>. Maqbali <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMaqbali2016PasswordGenerators">10</a>]</span> and McEvoy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMcevoy2016ContextualizingMnemonicPhrase">228</a>]</span> recommend using contextual or site-specific cues on
websites as mnemonics.
<!--l. 348--><p class="noindent" >Memorization by repetitive training has also been suggested. Bonneau and Schechter put forward
solution that is supposed to help users memorize &#8220;56 bit secrets&#8221; (for comparison, the original
NIST guideline demanded 30 bit) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2014ReliableStorage56Bits">37</a>]</span>. Users first pick a self-selected password. They system
then displays a random code (or words) for each user at login-time which needs to be
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
typed correctly into a separate field. The code becomes part of the password and was
displayed with increasing delays. But participants could skip the delay by entering the code
from memory. After a median of 36 log-ins 96% of participants had memorized a 56
bit secret. Despite the high success rates, it is questionable if this type of aide is in the
users&#8217; interest, especially if it is deployed by more than one service. In a similar vein,
Kroeze and Olivier proposed using gamification to make the training more enjoyable
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication">203</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 351--><p class="noindent" >In terms of security, mnemonic passwords are predictably based on common phrases from movies,
literature, songs, etc., but stronger than intuitively selected passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKuo2006HumanSelectionMnemonic">205</a>]</span>. Yang et al.
demonstrate that even mnemonic phrase-based passwords can be attacked easily <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYang2016MnemonicSentenceBased">377</a>]</span>. Thus, like
Zhang-Kennedy, they highlight the importance of original, personal phrases and show how users
can be instructed effectively.
<!--l. 355--><p class="noindent" ><span class="paragraphHead"><a 
 id="x1-1030003.3.3"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Passphrases</span></span>
Another technique proposed to create strong, memorable passwords is to create passphrases. Rather
than taking single letters from a phrase, we understand them as a combination of words, e.g. the
paragon &#8220;<span 
class="ectt-1200">CorrectHorseBatteryStaple</span>&#8221;. Passphrases are usually longer than traditional
pass<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">words </span>and thus increase password strength. The PGP system uses passphrases to encrypt
private keys on the clients. Keith et al. showed that, at the same time, passphrases are more
memorable than more complex passwords, especially if they include punctuation symbols <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKeith2009PassphraseDesign">188</a>]</span>.
However, participants in their study made significantly more errors, which is the biggest
usability caveat of long passphrases. On devices where text-entry is cumbersome (e.g. on
mobiles or smart TVs), refraining from masking entry can mitigate this problem <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">229</a>]</span>.
Paradoxically, passphrases sometimes exceed character limits for passwords on certain websites
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">49</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 358--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, Bonneau showed that user-selected passphrases are predictable <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">38</a>]</span>. To mitigate
predictable word combinations, system-assigned passphrases have been evaluated. Shay et al.
conclude that this boosts strength, but users dislike them <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">293</a>]</span>. Similarly, policies focused on
passphrases (e.g. 2word16) lead to passwords with high guess numbers, but users struggle to create
them <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>]</span>. The Diceware approach is often mentioned as a means to randomize word selection

user rolls a dice firve times and notes down the resulting numbers. Afterwards, they look up the
word with the corresponding number from the Diceware wordlist. The process should be repeated
at least twice to create a passphrase. Unfortunately, the process requires some dedication, time, and
a dice. Nonetheless, passphrases usually do not require a change to the provider&#8217;s system, which
makes them a viable, memorable and secure option, e.g. if they are mostly entered with a physical
keyboard.

to memorize them. However, generating passwords that are consistently pronounceable is
challenging<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWhite2014IsntThatFabulous">366</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#XKurzban1985Passphrases">206</a>]</span>. The second
option yields truly random character strings taken from an alphabet large enough to
mitigate most guessing attacks (see example in Figure 3.4). Huh et al. propose letting
users replace a certain number of characters to create a more memorable version of the
random password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHuha2015UserReplaceablePasswords">170</a>]</span>. However, memorization of random strings is still exceptionally
tedious for most users, as is typing them. Therefore, such passwords need to be either be
written down or stored inside a password manager. Most password managers (see Section
3.2.3), offer to generate passwords. Moreover, the Safari browser suggests a randomly
generated password to users and stores it into Apple&#8217;s cloud storage Keychain. Relying on a
password manager gives users a number of usability benefits <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYee2006Passpet">380</a>]</span>. As mentioned above,
auto-fill reduces interaction times and recall problems. If passwords are generated on the
fly, the effort to create passwords is removed. It is easy to generate unique passwords
for each account and thwart phishing attacks, so the PWM scales with the number of
accounts. Some PWMs give the users feedback to assess their overall protection level (see
Chapters 8 and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). On the downside, users become dependent on the PWM, which
makes it difficult to roam and use other devices. Even if users do not generate passwords,
they lose muscle memory with auto-fill, so it is cognitively more challenging to log in
manually.
<!--l. 387--><p class="noindent" >HCI researchers have tried to solve these problems. Stobert and Biddle proposed VersiPass <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PWMThatDoesntRemember">311</a>]</span>. It
uses graphical authentication and hints to avoid losing muscle memory, but it has not been
empirically evaluated. Tapas is a decentralized password manager based on two-factor
authentication, which was well received in two user studies <span class="cite">[<a

extension that lets users pick a &#8220;pet name&#8221; (label) for each website they have signed up for <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYee2006Passpet">380</a>]</span>.
The label is part of the password hashing and aims to increase both the security and memorability
of the scheme, similar to the Password Multiplier system by Halderman et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHalderman2005ConvenientPWM">147</a>]</span>.
Fagan et al. investigated the reasons for (not) adopting a password manager <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFagan2017UsersConsiderationsPWMs">103</a>]</span>. They
found that users more prominently appreciate usability benefits. Those who do not use a
PWM distrusted the security, potentially due to a sub-par mental model. We can also
hypothesize that many users want to stay independent and not give away control to a third
party.
<!--l. 390--><p class="noindent" >In summary, password managers aide users with password selection, and scaling the increasing
number of accounts. Generated passwords are mostly a go-to method for more proficient,
security-aware users who actively seek to strengthen their passwords as much as possible. While
the academic research community has not been able to create PWM solutions with widespread
adoption, many commercial solutions exist. However, the adoption rates indicate that current
systems have not been fully adapted to the masses.

<!--l. 402--><p class="noindent" >Persuading users to behave differently is the last line of attack we shall discuss in this part. Using
technology to persuade users can be traced back to Fogg&#8217;s seminal work on &#8220;captology&#8221;, which was
later recoined under the umbrella term <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">persuasive technology </span><span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFogg2002Persuasive">120</a>]</span>. He defines it as &#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">interactive</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">computing system designed to change people&#8217;s attitudes or behaviors</span>&#8221;. Persuasion itself is seen as
&#8220;an attempt to change attitudes or behaviors or both (without using coercion or deception)&#8221;. The
latter part further distinguishes persuasion from manipulation, where people are not aware of the
manipulator&#8217;s intentions. Password composition policies exert authority and coerce users to follow
the rules. The need for autonomy as part of the Self-determination theory <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRyan2000SelfDeterminationTheory">269</a>]</span> is thus
undermined by policies. User education is voluntary and misses its goal because users
seldom decide to educate themselves on password security. Therefore, persuasion could
fill the gap of providing transparent education by making alternative behavior more
salient <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. In the context of this thesis, we thus understand persuasive technology as an
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">enabling </span>technology that adequately supports users while respecting their preferences.
Persuasion in HCI has become an essential topic with numerous papers published at top-tier
conferences. Hekler already highlighted the rising interest already in 2013 <span class="cite">[<a

persuasion is one of the central topics among the top-5 most cited CHI-papers of the past five

 id="x1-1070003.4.1"></a>Terminology in Persuasion and Behavioral Economics</h5>
<!--l. 409--><p class="noindent" >In the design of persuasive technology, we often encounter the concept of &#8220;nudging&#8221; people, i.e.
figuratively giving them a small push to act in a certain way <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XThaler2008Nudge">328</a>]</span>. The &#8220;choice architect&#8221; decides
on the direction of the push <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XThaler2010ChoiceArchitecture">329</a>]</span>. For instance, by setting clever <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">defaults</span>, people are relieved of
making an active decision and can just accept the default. Nudging strategies as part of &#8220;soft
paternalism&#8221; or &#8220;libertarian paternalism&#8221; stem from the field of behavioral economics, which
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
studies &#8220;how individual, social, cognitive, and emotional biases influence economic decisions&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAcquisti2008DigitalPrivacy">2</a>]</span>.
In other words, behavioral economists embrace the idea that people sometimes act irrationally
when making economic decisions. For example, people are significantly more likely
to purchase a glass of jam, if there are only six options instead of 24 &#8211; the so-called
&#8220;choice paradox&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XIyengar2000WhenChoiceIsDemotivating">174</a>]</span>. As we have seen in Section 3.2, password coping strategies
ultimately involve such economic decisions: Given a risk, one needs to assess the severity,
likelihood, costs of mitigating the risk, and the effectiveness of the protective measure <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSchneier2008PsychologySecurity">279</a>]</span>.
Thus, theories from behavioral economics are a useful resource that can explain user
behavior.
<!--l. 412--><p class="noindent" >Referring to the dual process theory, Kahneman argues that many sub-optimal decisions originate
from System 1 which is responsible for intuitive and automatic thinking processes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKahnemann2002">184</a>]</span>.
System 2, on the other hand, is the rational and effortful part in our thinking processes.
He explains that most of our thinking is carried out by System 1, because it would be
impossible to put the same amount of effort into every decision that we make (e.g. it is
unnecessary to weigh the pro&#8217;s and con&#8217;s in answering &#8220;should I brush my teeth today?&#8221;). In
Password selection, both systems are involved, but depending on the context, one or the
other is primarily responsible for the decision. For instance, users who have formed
the habit to reuse one password for all accounts will do the same for the next account
they create, thus the automatic System 1 is at play. However, if the composition policy
forces the user to modify their password, the cognitive challenge rises and activates
System 2. Persuasive technology aims to either facilitate decision-making (i.e. supporting
System 1), or block automatic processes to help the user adopt a different behavior (i.e.
activating System 2). For instance, intentionally introducing delays during password
authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMalkin2013Waiting">218</a>]</span> or in browser warnings <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2010PleaseContinueToHold">96</a>]</span> lead to users spending more time on the
task and act more securely, probably because the time was enough to activate System
2.

<span class="cite">[<a

shortcuts in decision-making. <span

necessarily bad, but even necessary to get through life <span class="cite">[<a

decisions in cybersecurity, especially for mainstream users. For example, it is hard for users to
assess the risk of threats online, and make a decision on the required protection level. Therefore,

watch a movie at a theater. They dislike it from the start and after 25 minutes, they feel the movie is
not going to get better. Due to the sunk costs of the ticket and unrecoverable effort to go to the
theater, it is likely that they stick around instead of simply leaving the show. Herley et al. hint a
similar scenario for replacing password authentication <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHerley2012PersistenceOfPasswords">165</a>]</span>. In their point of view,
service providers have invested into passwords and are now reluctant to move away to
alternative schemes, although they might improve system security (see Section 2.5).
Similarly, users who have committed to a password and reused it many times, might
see the time spent as sunk cost. Thus, they do not switch to a more secure alternative
even if they know there are plenty. Arguably, the <span

has become more salient and available, thus future occurrences are seen as more probable.
Das et al. partially confirmed such behavior through user interviews <span class="cite">[<a

had twelve fields, two of which were already stamped. So, in both cases, customers
received a free coffee after ten purchases. Surprisingly, more cards with twelve fields were
redeemed after the trial period. People (wrongly) thought to be closer to goal, and thus
were more motivated to achieve it. This &#8220;goal distance model&#8221; is sometimes used by
password meters, i.e. a visualization of password strength (we discuss them in great detail
in Section 3.4.3). Password strength visualization can give the user a &#8220;head start&#8221; to
motivate them to fill up the entire bar and achieve a &#8220;strong password&#8221; (i.e. a full loyalty

which highlights this blend of psychology and persuasion. There is, however, no such list for
patterns specifically for interventions in usable security and privacy. Therefore, we start
with the discussion of general frameworks and put them into the context of security and
passwords.

<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">t</span>riggers (B=mat) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFogg2009BehavioralModel">119</a>]</span>. For passwords, this implies that people need to be motivated to protect
themselves, at the same time the need to know how to achieve protection and be exposed to a
trigger. Triggers work best when presented at the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">opportune moment </span>(or ) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLockton2010DesignWithIntent">214</a>]</span>. Lockton et al.
proposed the &#8220;Design with Intent&#8221; framework as a toolkit for persuasive interventions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLockton2010DesignWithIntent">214</a>]</span>.
Jameson et al. show how to pick strategies from various toolkits to create a persuasive choice
architecture <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XJameson2011PreferentialChoice">179</a>]</span>. Cialdini&#8217;s generic &#8220;<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">six weapons of influence</span>&#8221; have been used in the design of
persuasive technology <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCialdini2007Influence">58</a>]</span>. He lists authority, scarcity, liking, social proof, commitment &amp;
consistency, and reciprocity as the principles of persuasion. Let us walk through their potential
usage in password authentication. The authority principle says that people are likely to follow the
instructions of an authority, which explains why the NIST guidelines have been widely adopted
despite their downsides. Scarcity drives motivation to act quickly to avoid losing an opportunity
(see loss aversion), and framing effects are used to communicate the scarcity of a resource. For
instance, the &#8220;419 scam&#8221; tactic in phishing emails frames time as a scarce resource: &#8220;your
account has been intruded, if you don&#8217;t log in now, you lose access to it permanently&#8221;
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStajano2011Principles">308</a>]</span>. In this case, persuasion is used for malicious purposes. People prefer to comply
if they <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">like </span>their counterpart. In theory, this would make password requirements less
bothersome if used on a website that users like, or in a more aesthetically pleasing way.
Although there is no empirical evidence that the principle works for registration forms
specifically, other HCI research points in this direction <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTractinsky2000WhatIsBeautiful">332</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XFogg2001WhatMakesSitesCredible">121</a>]</span>. The social proof
strategy makes other people&#8217;s behavior more <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">available </span>because in decision-making people
tend to copy others&#8217; decisions. For instance, it might help to point out that millions of
users are already using a password manager in a news article about a new password
leak. We can also apply Fogg&#8217;s behavior model here: Reading about a password leak
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">motivates </span>users to protect themselves, the social proof strategy acts as a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">trigger</span>, and
mentioning the ease-of-use of password managers gives users confidence about their
ability to adopt a PWM. The commitment &amp; consistency principle is an immediate part of
the Password Life Cycle <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span>. People try to be consistent with their past behavior and
their past values. Thus, a small step towards breaking an insecure habit might, in fact,
induce more secure behavior afterward. If a policy forced a user to stop using a common
password, the effort to commit to the new password might spread over to other accounts, too.
Stobert found that cybersecurity experts show higher signs of consistency <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2015ExpertPassword">313</a>]</span>. Thus, if
another persuasive strategy achieves that users commit to a new password selection
scheme, their behavior might become more consistent and thus be elevated to the expert
level. Finally, reciprocity describes the desire to return a favor. To use it as a persuasive
design strategy, one has to do something favorable for the users first. Thus, offering
users to store their passwords in a secure place and automatically logging them in is a
good foundation to ask them later to turn on 2-factor authentication to help secure their
account.

<!--l. 488--><p class="noindent" >The <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">simplification </span>principle posits to reduce the number of tasks to achieve an overall goal. Thus,
the hypothetical distance between start state and goal is shorter, so, goal-gradient effects become
visible. Password managers usually simplify authentication by reducing the best-case interaction
from Recall-Enter-Submit to Submit. Fagan et al. showed that simplification is the primary reason
to adopt a password manager <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFagan2017UsersConsiderationsPWMs">103</a>]</span>. But even without a PWM, both the &#8220;recall&#8221; and
the &#8220;enter&#8221; sub-tasks can be simplified. Recall is facilitated with consistent password
strategies. Entering is easier the primary password is replaced by a less complex one-time
password.
<!--l. 491--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Personalization</span>, as understood in the PAF, encompasses tailoring the experience to an individual
user, or to suggest actions. A recently (<span id="textcolor12"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">@ref</span></span>) emerged design pattern spreads out the log-in process
across two separate steps for username and password, rather than having the two input
fields visible at once. After submitting the username, the page is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">tailored </span>to the user by
showing them their profile picture and/or another piece of non-critical personal information.
At the same time, this establishes a light-weight trusted path <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYe2005TrustedPaths">379</a>]</span>. Wilkinson et al.
suggest personalizing privacy by design by giving users different levels of control to
depending on their privacy profile <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWilkinson2017UserTailoredPBD">372</a>]</span>. Besides, this is a good example of the paternalism in
persuasive interventions, because the designer what option is &#8220;better&#8221; for the individual user.
Similarly, it is conceivable to personalize password policies depending on the user&#8217;s
&#8220;password profile&#8221; (see 14.1.2). Moreover, personality constructs have been investigated
to tailor user experiences, which perhaps exceeds the original proposition in the PAF.
Recently, Egelman and Peer advocated the use of psychometric cues to contextualize
privacy or security messaging, which they call the &#8220;next frontier in privacy and security
research&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2015AverageUser">99</a>]</span>. Jeske et al. investigated user profiles for the susceptibility to security nudges
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XJeske2014NudgingWhomHow">181</a>]</span>. In their experiment, they used <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">salience </span>to steer users away from insecure wireless
networks. They found that participants with low impulse control were more susceptible to
nudges. The finding can be interpreted that nudges directed at System 1 seem more
effective. There is also preliminary evidence that susceptibility to phishing, i.e. a social
nudge, is also related to personality <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHalevi2013PilotStudyPersonality">148</a>]</span>. It stands to reason that password selection
is related to personality, too (see Chapter 7). If this were the case, a new spectrum of
personalization strategies arises. Haque et al. have already proposed a psychometric
construct to identify such associations <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHaque2014PsychometricsStrongPassword">153</a>]</span>. Forget et al. list <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">suggestion </span>as part of the
personalization dimension, because suggestions might be based on a personal context
factors. They provided a number of cases studies on suggestive password alterations
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XForget2008MemorabilityPersuasivePasswords">122</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XForget2008PersuasionStrongerPasswords">127</a>]</span>. The &#8220;persuasive text passwords&#8221; (PTP) system takes a user&#8217;s password and either
randomly inserts characters or replaces existing characters to increase strength. The high
resemblance to the original password is supposed to maintain memorability <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2008MemorabilityPersuasivePasswords">122</a>]</span>. Shay
et al. later re-evaluated the approach in an MTurk study, which yielded mixed results
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">296</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 499--><p class="noindent" >Arguably, observing what users do increases the chances that they comply to security policies,

is a moderate approach to secure users&#8217; Google accounts. It is a browser extension that alerts the
user if they type in the password of their Google account on unrelated web pages. Hence, the idea is
to make sure users use a unique password for their Google account, which is a central hub for
various services. To work properly, the browser extension needs to access every keystroke.
Some users might distrust it because, although it is open source, it is hard for them to tell
if their private data is collected. Prospect theory tells us that in this judgment under
uncertainty, losing private data is attributed a higher value than the security gain. A less
privacy-invasive design element that might help in relieving uncertainty is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">self-monitoring</span>.
Self-monitoring through <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">feedback-loops </span>&#8211; another design pattern <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLidwell2003UniversalPrinciplesOfDesign">210</a>]</span> &#8211; allows users to reflect
on their past actions and derive alternatives to attain their goal. Some PWMs create a
&#8220;security score&#8221; for each user and persuade them to improve it (see Table 12.1 in Chapter
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>).
<!--l. 503--><p class="noindent" >Users rarely develop habits to act securely. Thus, Forget et al. argue to use various forms of
reinforcement to persuade people to develop such habits. Rewarding users for secure
password behavior serves to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">condition </span>them. Google Drive, for instance, offered
users more cloud storage quota if they completed a two-minute security check-up

Positive feedback during password selection can condition users, too. Other rewards, e.g. longer
session expiration or faster system response, have not seen significant uptake.
<!--l. 506--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, the PAF includes <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social interactions </span>as persuasive design strategy. Forget et al. posit that
authentication systems mimick, e.g., the users&#8217; language to convey &#8220;team spirit&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2008PersuasionStrongerPasswords">127</a>]</span>. Weirich and
Sasse <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">364</a>]</span>, respectively Sasse and Flechais <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">273</a>]</span>, similarly describe authentication as
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">socio-technical system </span>that follows a social protocol. DiGioia and Dourish formulated the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">navigation </span>pattern <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDiGioia2005SocialNavigationUsableSecurity">87</a>]</span>. To perceive the system as capable communication partner, signs of
previous interactions inspire trust. Egelman et al. tried to nudge users during password selection
through the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social proof  </span>strategy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">100</a>]</span>. A visualization informed the study participants how well
their password fared compared to other users, e.g. &#8220;your password is stronger than that of 85% of
our users&#8221;. They did not find evidence that this persuasive strategy influenced people, but maybe
the approach could have been more focused on the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">proof  </span>aspect, rather than <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">competition</span>. The
normative message can be read as &#8220;other people&#8217;s passwords are bad, but many people act this
way&#8221;. This could actually evoke backfire effects through social proof: although users see their
password is stronger, they believe that the social norm is to pick weaker passwords,
which makes them conform to the social norm. In fact, Weirich and Sasse have provided
empirical evidence for such behavior <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">364</a>]</span>. Social interactions are perhaps one of the most
powerful design elements to persuade users: Das et al. reported that radical behavior
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
changes often occurred due to social processes <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDas2014EffectSocialInfluenceSecuritySensitivity">69</a>]</span>. They argue that it is critical for
users to observe experts in their social circle to raise their awareness and motivation for
cybersecurity. Thus, persuasive design could make expert behavior of known peers more
visible
<!--l. 509--><p class="noindent" >In a number of ways, some ideas from the Persuasive Authentication Framework were rather
optimistic and from today&#8217;s point of view they appear questionable (e.g. conditioning users like
animals). Much evidence from the ten years that followed its publication shows that persuasion
does not always work as intended, so maybe a few suggestions were a bit naive. Renaud et al.
evaluated eight nudges that were supposed to make students create stronger passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRenaud2017LessonsLearnedNudges">263</a>]</span>. They
reached the disheartening conclusion that none of them work. Nevertheless, certain aspects have
caught on and are actively used, like Google&#8217;s Password Alert which is a direct implementation of
Forget et al.&#8217;s ideas. We can conclude that the PAF has matured over time, with certain
components receiving more weight through empirical evidence, and others becoming
obsolete. Thus, a revision could incorporate our newly gained understanding of persuasive
authentication.
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1120003.4.2"></a>Dark Patterns</h5>
<!--l. 513--><p class="noindent" >At the outset of this chapter, we discussed ethics as critical factor in password studies. Using
persuasion inherently becomes ethically problematic if the intention of the influencer is concealed,
either by poor design or by choice. Persuasive techniques are used to manipulate, too. Many social
engineering scams on malicious websites use persuasion techniques, too. Muscanell&#x00A0;et al.
investigated the misuse of Cialdini&#8217;s weapons of influence in cyber scams <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMuscanell2014WeaponsMisused">235</a>]</span>. They found that
scammers exploit all of them in social engineering attacks. Muscanell et al. also propose mitigation
strategies, but do not lay them out in detail. Attacks that take advantage of &#8220;scarcity&#8221; as persuasive
strategy often rely on <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fear appeals</span>, e.g. &#8220;Your computer is infected, download this software
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">now </span>to remove all threats&#8221;. Xu et al. proposed using similar fear appeals to nudge users
towards anti-spyware measures <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XXu2007FearAppeals">375</a>]</span>, and Vance et al. utilized the &#8220;time to crack&#8221; as fear
appeal during password selection <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVance2013FearAppeals">343</a>]</span>. There are a number of &#8220;dark patterns&#8221;, which
Nodder dismantles in his book &#8220;Evil by Design&#8221; <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XNodder2013EvilByDesign">240</a>]</span>. Some of them are still benign,
others highly manipulative. DarkPatterns.org summarizes them briefly, e.g. <span

However, Sasse strongly urges to resist them in the design of password persuasion because they
wear off over time and often exaggerate the risks <span class="cite">[<a

research. It is hard to trace back their origins, but proactive password checks have been part of
policies since the late 1980s <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWheeler2016zxcvbn">365</a>]</span>. Bishop and Klein developed the <span

that was used to give terminal-users feedback on their password selection <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBishop1995ProactivePasswordChecking">26</a>]</span>. A core challenge
is the strength estimation proxy. Websites cannot implement a full-fledged cracking

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1140003.4.3"></a>Effective or not?</h5>
<!--l. 542--><p class="noindent" >A number of studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of password meters. Ur et al.
explored 14 different designs, respectively settings, of password meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">339</a>]</span>: different variations
of the &#8220;bar&#8221; visualization, different stringency parameters, suggestions, and nudges.
They were able to identify significant differences in passwords strength depending on
the meter. Very stringent meters led to stronger passwords. Any kind of visual meter
resulted in longer passwords, so text-only feedback is less persuasive. Many participants in
their mTurk study added another character at the end to receive a higher rating from the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
meter. Qualitative feedback and usability ratings showed that the stringent meters were
unpleasant for many participants, reducing their persuasive power. Egelman et al. investigated
context factors in the effectiveness of meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">100</a>]</span>. They found that password meters
seemed to have a greater positive effect on strength, if they were displayed on a site with
higher perceived value. Participants in that study did not &#8220;need&#8221; the password meter, but
receiving feedback on highly values websites made their importance more available.
At the same time they concluded, that the design of the meter plays an insignificant
role and that social nudges do not affect strength either. Moreover, both Ur et al.&#8217;s and
Egelman et al.&#8217;s study showed that memorability was not affected by the meters. The
meter with the highest reported effects was recently presented by Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>. After
carefully evaluating the design space for rhetorical framing of strength feedback <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEargle2015YouCanDoBetter">91</a>]</span>,
they isolated the components of password meters and compared their effectiveness.
They found that textual feedback is recommendable to create more persuasive meters.
However, the policy affects the effectiveness, too. Their final design (see Figure 3.7) uses
a number of persuasive elements: A visual bar to simplify communicating password
strength; text feedback about the strength; explanations about the scoring with clear calls
to action (tunneling strategy); and lastly, a personalized suggestion of an alternative
password.

<!--l. 555--><p class="noindent" >Visualizing strength is not the only way to design a password meter. Komanduri et al. crafted a sly
prototype to tell users their passwords are predictable: their <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Telepathwords </span>system predicts the next
character the user is about to type <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKomanduri2014Telepathwords">198</a>]</span>. The rationale of the system is that users do not
mindlessly enter a weak password anymore, i.e. that the feedback should activate System 2
thinking processes. Furthermore, realizing that the next character can be automatically
guessed might evoke fear appeal and steer people away from predictable passwords.
Komanduri et al. evaluated Telepathwords with an mTurk-study using a role-playing scenario.
They found that password created in the Telepathwords groups outperformed traditional
password policies in regard to strength and memorability. However, participants were
significantly more annoyed by Telepathwords, perhaps because of the inconvenient truth
and fear appeal. Communicating password strength with background information is
another technique to persuade users. For example, Yee et al. displayed the estimated
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">time-to-crack </span>when users selected a master password for the PassPet password manager
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XYee2006Passpet">380</a>]</span>. For users, it is much easier to translate this metric into a behavior than a numeric
score like &#8220;3/5&#8221;. Vance et al. found that such fear-appeal strategies persuade users to
read password advice and modify weak passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVance2013FearAppeals">343</a>]</span>. Khern-am-nuai et al. also
measured the persuasiveness of context-based warning messages as part of the password
meter <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKhern-am-nuai2017ContextBasedMeter">193</a>]</span>. They found that participants in their mTurk-study made significantly more
changes to their initial choice when a warning was present, e.g. &#8220;Weak. We estimate
that the password you chose is among the 30,000 weakest passwords&#8221;. However, the
study suffered from a few important limitations (e.g. removing all data from users who
were unable to log-in after 30 to 60 minutes). Kroeze and Olivier proposed evolving a
Pokemon figure as users type to visualize the growth in strength <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKroeze2012GamifyingAuthentication">203</a>]</span>. Furnell and Esmael
evaluated feedback through emojis and found positive effects on the length of user-selected
passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFurnell2017GuidanceCompliance">129</a>]</span>. Afjan et al. allowed users to interactively explore the visualization they
had received from the password meter <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAljaffan2017PasswordSecurityVisualizer">12</a>]</span>. Ur et al. report that an animated dancing
bunny that speeds up with increasing strength was unable to nudge users more effectively
than less exciting meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">339</a>]</span>. Shay et al. tried to help users select a stronger password
through a wizard that explained mnemonic phrase-based passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">296</a>]</span>. Besides, they
compared this strategy to the insertion approach we saw in Forget et al.&#8217;s persuasive text
passwords (PTP) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>]</span>. Both approaches were generally disliked by the participants,
though.
<!--l. 563--><p class="noindent" >Apart from pure strength visualization and persuasive messages, real-time feedback can accompany
a password policy. The user sees a list of requirements and as they enter their password, they get
feedback on the aspects that have already been fulfilled, which was originally proposed by Proctor
et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XProctor2002ImprovingAuthenticationProactivePasswordRestrictions">255</a>]</span>. Although we know by now that the resulting passwords are not necessarily
stronger, Shay et al. found that this kind of checklist can reduce user frustration with
policies in general <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">296</a>]</span>. Feedback is also crucial if the policy utilizes blacklists to ban too
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
easily guessed passwords <span class="cite">[<a

meter for situations where blacklists are present <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>]</span>. They found that text feedback
mitigates insecure selection especially for those users who intended to use a blacklisted
password.

<!--l. 567--><p class="noindent" >Evidence about the effectiveness of password meters is mixed, but Ur et al.&#8217;s strategy might be one
of the most persuasive ones, because it combines many techniques that have proven successful in
different areas of persuasion <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>. So, in certain contexts, password meters can definitely nudge
users towards more secure behavior.
<!--l. 569--><p class="noindent" >However, where there is light, there is also shadow. Meters influence users&#8217; mental models
of password strength in similar ways as policies. However, as with policies, it is near
impossible to reach consensus on all parameters of pro-active measures and metrics for all
contexts. De Carné de Carnavalet and Mannan showed that the estimation algorithms in
real-world password meters largely differ, which is a result of the natural constraints of
pro-active checks <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDeCarnedeCarnavalet2015PasswordMeters">74</a>]</span>. Such inconsistencies, which were also observed by Ur et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2012HowDoesYourPasswordMeasureUp">339</a>]</span>,
have high potential to confuse users: if their password is rated &#8220;strong&#8221; on one site,
and &#8220;weak&#8221; on another, much explanation is going to be necessary to let the users find
out why the ratings differ. Persuasive interventions probably fail at that moment. The
authors suggest zxcvbn as the most robust password meter for websites and the KeePass
meter as an alternative for offline tools. Others have addressed the issues of industry
password meters. Wang et al. developed <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">fuzzyPSM </span>based on an optimized version of
PCFG <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWang2016fuzzyPWM">356</a>]</span>. Melicher et al. implemented their neural network strength estimation in
password meters, too <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">230</a>]</span>. Tupsamudre et al. demonstrated that a sudden surge of n-gram
scores can be used to proactively detect modifications of common passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XTupsamudre2016MarkovStrength">333</a>]</span>.
Improvements will continue to surface, but in recent years we can at least observe a trend towards
more homogeneous strength estimation due to the gained knowledge about guessing
attacks.

      to offer the best trade-off regarding usability, deployability and security compared to
      other schemes. Single-Sign On, multi-factor, as well as biometric authentication have
      gained importance and are likely to be further adopted in the future. Especially implicit

      Thus, the results of a number of studies would need to be reassessed or replicated

      attacks  on  passwords.  Configuring  attacks  is  not  trivial  but  crucial  for  the  results.
      Currently, the Password Guessing Services is seen as the most robust tool. If cracking

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1230005.1"></a>Background and Context</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Users create passwords on a regular basis. As discussed in Chapter 3, previous research indicates
that users most commonly resort to weaker passwords that are easy to remember. In case the
account value is higher, however, it is suspected that users invest more effort into creating a
stronger password. Password meters are helpful in this context <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">100</a>]</span>. Yet, even these
stronger passwords are often ineffective against sophisticated guessing attacks, so it
stands to reason that users have a subpar mental model of what makes a strong password.
This has been a commonly accepted assumption <span id="textcolor13"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">@ref</span></span>but it oversimplifies the state of
affairs.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >First, mental models change over time &#8211; both on a micro- and a macro-scale. At micro-scale, it is
evident that the first passwords are chosen in teenage years and without much care for security
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">350</a>]</span>. Over time, users are exposed to password advice and educational nudges: popular news
portals regularly publish new articles that report on data breaches or warn about risky online
behavior. This and incidents in one&#8217;s own social network <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">312</a>]</span> raise awareness about the topic and
can spark plans to behave differently in the future. Moreover, registering with multiple services
increases the likelihood of facing different password policies and password meters which nudges
users to reflect on their password choice. Potentially they might also alter their mental models if
feedback and policy instructions are well-designed <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">296</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>. The literature already has some
evidence that, overall, password behavior has positively changed in the past few decades
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRiley2006WhatUsersKnowWhatTheyDo">265</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSchneier2006RealWorldPasswords">278</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >Zooming out to the macro level, efforts to educate users may have already paid off. In the early
days of research in Usable Security, often the user was seen as the &#8220;weakest link&#8221; in a
secure system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XAdams1997MakingPWsSecureAndUsable">4</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSasse2005UsableSecurityPosition">273</a>]</span>. When Florêncio and Herley conducted their large-scale study in
2006/2007, they saw relatively low-entropy passwords, but higher-value accounts were a bit
better protected. However, in 2015 Ur et al. found that users&#8217; mental models had become
better which allowed them to create stronger and memorable passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2015PWCreationLab">341</a>]</span>. A year
later, they presented an in-depth analysis of the perceptions of password strength <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>.
They found that for the most part, participants in their online-study were capable of
identifying the factors that add to password strength. Shay et al. already used &#8220;perceived
strength&#8221; as a proxy metric <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">296</a>]</span>, and it seems this is a better approach than one might
think. For a few notable exceptions, though, certain password characteristics fooled
participants. Ur et al. argue that errors in mental models about strength arise from false
understandings of attackers. Consequently, it would be necessary to shift education from password
strength towards attackers, because users already have a fairly accurate understanding of
strength.
<!--l. 22--><p class="noindent" >Florêncio et al. put forward a formal model as to why users behave insecurely. Their central
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
argument is that it is inevitable to choose weak passwords for some accounts and that users are well
aware of their behavior. Yet, if users have a faulty understanding of password strength then
the selection process is biased. In the case of users also showing the overconfidence
bias, where people are subjectively more confident in their abilities and judgments than
the objective accuracy of the judgments <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSimonson1989ChoiceBasedOnReasons">303</a>]</span>, this could indeed lead to considerable
risks.
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >In summary, having a clear mental model of what makes for a strong password is essential to make
the decision whether to use one or not. While there are initial results, the perceptions of these
factors is still understudied to this point.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.1.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1240005.1.1"></a>Research Objectives</h4>
<!--l. 28--><p class="noindent" >In this project, I wanted to investigate the origin of weak passwords. I challenged the folk model
that users behave insecurely due to their lack of knowledge (as proposed by <span id="textcolor14"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">@ref</span></span>). If
users are able to identify weak and strong passwords, it is fair to assume they can select
appropriately strong passwords depending on the situation. With this knowledge, we can rethink
password feedback. As pointed out above, current password meters and verbal feedback
might be ineffective because if the majority of users is aware of the strength of their
password. Instead, feedback could be framed around re-use or attack models. Solidifying
evidence from related work with a novel study approach was a fruitful step towards making
a holistic design recommendation regarding the feedback aspect of password support
systems.

<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >To evaluate (in)accuracies in mental models about password strength, I chose to have users rate
passwords similarly to the study task in Ur et al.&#8217;s study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>. In their presentation at CHI 2016,
they challenged the audience which sparked the idea of making a game out of this task. To open the
game to a large audience, I decided to implement it as a web-application that runs in any web
browser on various platform.

 id="x1-1270005.2.1"></a>Game Mechanics and Design Elements</h4>
<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >The game is relatively simple: Players judge how strong or weak a given password is. They receive
points by accurately estimating the strength of a given password on a scale from 1 (weak) to 5
(strong). The game follows similar design strategies for the password topologies as the Ur et al.&#8217;s
online study, but passwords are either randomly taken from large dictionaries or generated on the
fly. To induce intuitive estimations, a time-limit is enforced while a &#8220;highscore&#8221; acts as incentive to
estimate as accurately as possible. To reach higher scores, one has to judge as many passwords as
possible in 60 seconds.
<!--l. 58--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1280005.2.1"></a>Scoring and Metrics</h5>
<!--l. 59--><p class="noindent" >A crucial point of the game is how the passwords are rated objectively. Here, we rely on the zxcvbn
library<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></span><a 
 id="x1-128001f1"></a><span class="footnote-mark"><a

(described in detail in Section 2.3) because it is highly reliable and straightforward to use on a web
page. It also comes with a number of word lists that are helpful to implement different scenarios,
respectively conditions. Beside the guess-number metric, zxcvbn also scores passwords on a scale
from zero (weak) to four (strong). We translate this scale to one star (weak) to five stars (strong) in
the game.
<!--l. 61--><p class="noindent" >For a correct estimation, a match between zxcvbn score and the player&#8217;s score, a player is awarded
100 points. The difference between the user&#8217;s rating and the zxcvbn score is the <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">deviation </span>(<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">D</span>). A
player&#8217;s rating can deviate by at most four stars, e.g. if they rate a five-star password with a score of
one and vice versa. In that case, the player should not get any points, but in all other cases, the
player is still awarded fewer points. For each integral deviation in either direction there is a penalty
of 25 minus-points (maximum of 100 points, at most 4 errors, which leads to <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">100</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x2215;</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">4 = 25</span>). The
points of the estimations are summed up and build the <span 
class="ptmbi8t-x-x-120">achieved </span>score (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">A</span>). As an overall
accuracy measure, at the end of the game we calculate the ratio of achieved and possible
points and display it as percentage (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">P </span>). The game thus implements the following scoring
function, where <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">U </span>is the user&#8217;s estimation on a scale from 1 to 5, <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">Z </span>is the zxcvbn score
on the same scale, and <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span>is the number of passwords a user has rated within the time
limit.
<!--l. 63--><p class="noindent" >The scoring function takes an array of user ratings and zxcvbn scores for <span

them relate to the Persuasive Authentication Framework <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XForget2007PersuasionEducationSecurity">124</a>]</span>. First of all, we lower the barrier to
play the game through <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">simplification</span>: the task is immediately clear and does not require special
skills. Since one round only takes sixty seconds, it is easier for users to <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">commit </span>to finish the game.
The feedback screen uses positive <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">language </span>to create the notion of a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">social interaction</span>, which also
serves <span

ratings, i.e. a subtle form of <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">conditioning</span>. Moreover, the user interface is <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">tailored </span>to
the user, as they can see their own previous scores. Players can also create an account
through Google-federated SSO. If they log in, their profile picture and a personal greeting
<span

&#8220;right&#8221;, which can be attributed to the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">authority </span>principle. Finally, the game leverages the
<span

At the end, the player receives a score that seems improvable through playing another

&#8220;12345&#8221;, &#8220;password&#8221;, &#8220;monkey&#8221;), and the remaining passwords are scored with two
stars (e.g. &#8220;iloveyou2&#8221;, &#8220;skywalker&#8221;, &#8220;apollo13&#8221;). It is worth noting that many of these
passwords would not be accepted anymore by websites as common policies demand at
least 8 characters (see Chapter <span

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Mangled passwords: </span></span>
For the mangled password condition, we take the same list of the top 47023 passwords, but we
algorithmically substitute certain characters. The substitutions look like &#8220;leet&#8221; / &#8220;l33t&#8221; speak, which
is a typical way to try to increase password strength <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDas2014TangledWeb">68</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XMazurek2013Measuring">224</a>]</span>. For instance, an &#8220;a&#8221; is replaced by
an &#8220;&#8221;, or an &#8220;s&#8221; is substituted with the dollar sign &#8220;$&#8221;. Also, random characters are transformed to
uppercase. To allow recognizing the original word, we only mangle up to 30% of the characters of
the password. Since we only use substitutions that zxcvbn recognizes, mangled passwords
mostly receive a score of two. However, in rare occasions, they occupy the full range, i.e.,
&#8220;p@ssw0rd&#8221; (1), &#8220;b0n3he@d&#8221; (2), &#8220;fireFI9hter&#8221; (3), &#8220;123qaz456w$x&#8221; (4), &#8220;123Q@z4s6w$x&#8221;

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Random passwords: </span></span>
We implemented a simple string generation algorithm to create random passwords. They are
lowercase alphanumeric passwords containing letters from the German alphabet, i.e. [a-z0-9äöü].
Zxcvbn consistently gives them a score of four, which makes them easy to rate. In a real-world
attack they can only be brute-forced <span class="cite">[<a

 id="x1-1340005.2.2"></a><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Passphrases: </span></span>
We combine two entries from the English Wikipedia index to create a passphrase (also shipped
with zxcvbn). The words were required to be between 4 and 11 characters long. This restriction
leads to a dictionary size of 27202 entries. Thus, there are <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">27202</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2248; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">10</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">9</span> possible combinations,
which is unpredictable enough to withstand online guessing attacks. This is reflected by the rather
high scores: zxcvbn gives passphrases mostly a score of three or four, e.g. &#8220;armedtamils&#8221; (3),
&#8220;boostedeuros&#8221; (4). If the words appear in other dictionaries, e.g. the &#8220;TV subtitles&#8221;
word list, they are more likely to result in a score of three. However, for a user it is not
straight-forward to tell whether a passphrase scores three or four points, which makes
this condition harder to get right. The game is expected to benefit from this element of
<span

 id="x1-1350005.2.3"></a>Benefits and Shortcomings of the Game-based Approach</h4>
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >Since the game was deployed publicly, the method can be denoted as an unsupervised
in-the-wild study. This approach has certain benefits and shortcomings as discussed in the
following.
<!--l. 115--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1360005.2.3"></a>Benefits</h5>
<!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Easy collection of multiple data points per user </span>The game can be played over and over. A survey
could also be taken multiple times, but most of the time this is not desirable. If the study is
done via MTurk this would mean that people would be paid each time which drives
costs.
<!--l. 119--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Possibility to provide feedback </span>After the game, the players can review their ratings and find out
how they performed. In a study, implementing such a feedback loop is much more complicated and
often impossible with current survey tools. Hence, a debriefing step is required, but it&#8217;s difficult to
tailor it to the individual participant.
<!--l. 122--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Randomization and password space </span>Ur et al.&#8217;s study was designed well in that it tested a wide
range of password characteristics and there were multiple options per condition. However,
the options were predefined by the researchers and limited in that sense. In our case,
we can pick passwords from much larger word-lists at random and use algorithms to
randomly adjust certain characteristics. This allows for higher internal validity of the data
collection.
<!--l. 125--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Intrinsic Motivation </span>Participants in an online survey often receive an incentive to participate. In an
mTurk-studie each participant receives a small amount of money. Contrarily, there is no extrinsic
incentive to play PASDJO.
<!--l. 128--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Intuition </span>The game uses time pressure to induce intuitive responses. Thus, if playing fast
enough, we expect to measure System 1&#8217;s responses instead of System 2 <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKahnemann2011FastAndSlow">183</a>]</span>. This
is vital because password selection is often a System 1 process, i.e. an intuitive and
automatic. In an online survey, the participants can take as much time as they&#8217;d like to reason
about their response. However, this is a hypothetic benefit that needs further empirical
evidence.
<!--l. 130--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1370005.2.3"></a>Drawbacks</h5>
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<!--l. 131--><p class="noindent" >The game approach to collecting password strength perceptions naturally entails drawbacks, too.
First and foremost, we do not collect demographic data. In a survey, it is common practice to
include questions about basic demographic information. If we included such questions as part of
our game, we might have scared off users and damaged persuasive strategies. Thus, the collected
data stems from an unknown population, which is a limitation.
<!--l. 133--><p class="noindent" >Furthermore, the lack of demographic data also makes it hard to track usage across multiple
devices. The same player could first get in touch on a desktop and then later decide to keep playing
on their mobile. Allowing users to log in and synchronize their game history can mitigate this
problem to some degree.
<!--l. 135--><p class="noindent" >Last, ethically running password studies (see Section 3.1) demands that participants be debriefed
appropriately. In our case, we provide a separate &#8220;About&#8221; page that is accessible from anywhere in
the app. The information on the about page points out that users should refrain from using the
generated passwords as their own and that our strength estimation is only an estimate. Nevertheless,
it requires that users seek this kind information, which &#8211; realistically &#8211; only few people might do.
Therefore, as a small encouragement to read it, we require users to confirm a consent-dialog that
also points them to the about page.

which we hoped would lower the barrier to engage with the game. Since we expected many people
from Germany would play the game, the interface is fully localized. Depending on the
browser language, it automatically picks the preferred language. Moreover, the interface is
responsive to different screen sizes to provide a seamless experience. We chose a short URL
<a 
href="pasdjo.de" class="url" ><span 
class="ectt-1200">pasdjo.de</span></a> to facilitate visiting the website from mobile devices where typing is cumbersome.
Upon visiting the web page, a welcome screen briefly explains the rules (see Figure
5.3a). As part of our onboarding process, we give users the opportunity to try out the
rating interface, so they can get comfortable even before they play for the first time.
For mobile users, we had to ensure that the game loads quickly. This is challenging,
because we have to transfer a number of word lists to generate the passwords randomly.
Therefore, we used a lazy-loading design pattern to render the UI first and load data in the
background. At the same time, we minimize and compress the source files to reduce data
transfers. The first page load consumes 1.6 MB of data. To ensure subsequent visits are
faster and do not stress the user&#8217;s mobile quota, a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">service-worker </span>caches resources in the
background. It intercepts requests to the remote server in the future and instead serves local
resources<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">6</sup></span><a

This strategy reduces the transfer size for subsequent requests to a mere 10.3 KB, which are mostly
consumed by authentication and incremental synchronization.

game was first presented to the public at an open lab day in our research group. We set up a booth
and invited visitors to play the game on their own devices, although we also had two iPads that used
a shared, known account. Posters at our institution kept advertising for the game, and it was later
shown at student orientation days. Thus, it is very likely that the sample stems from a group of
mostly younger adults who are interested in technical innovation. After removing log data from the
known demo accounts, 115 users remained in the data set who had played at least one game on a
device unknown to us. Only two users chose to log in to keep their history synchronized across
devices.

<!--l. 163--><p class="noindent" >The 115 users played 242 full games in total. Thus, on average, a user played 2.1 full games
(SD=2.3, Min = 1, Max 16). The time pressure motivated users to rate as many passwords as
possible. We found that an average of 24.44 passwords (SD=10.39) were rated per game, which
amounts to 5915 passwords rated. Users spent <span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2248; </span>2.45 seconds per estimation on average. The
zxcvbn strength estimates were fairly consistent within each condition (see Figure 5.4). Random
passwords consistently received a score of 4 our of 5. Common passwords were either
rated with 1 or 2. Passwords in the Mangled condition filled the full spectrum of ratings,
but the majority had a score of 2. Interestingly, passphrases were the least predictable
condition. From <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 1414 </span>passphrases, 25.03% received a score of 3, and 74.54% a
score of 4. The remaining eight passphrases were deemed weaker with a score of 2,
e.g. <span 
class="ectt-1200">soilwithin </span>or <span 
class="ectt-1200">augsburgtime</span>, but it is not clear why this was the case (perhaps
because one of the words had a very low guess number). However, the vast majority
of passphrase-scores are explicable with the number of characters. For the users, the
length of the passphrase is then the only criterion to decide between a score of 3 and
4.

of passwords rated in that game. The model shows that players were able to improve
their accuracy by playing multiple times (F(1)=49.37, <span

performing linear regressions with average deviation of each condition as dependent
variable, with gameIndex as predictor, we observed that <span

the tendency. Players therefore primarily learned to estimate passphrases. Figure 5.6
visualizes the progress of users who played at least twice. In there, it is also evident that the
slope is not stringent, i.e. an individual user&#8217;s accuracy does not necessarily increase
steadily. We attribute this to the element of randomness in the game, which makes it more
difficult in some cases to rate the passwords, while it might be easier in a subsequent
game.

The mangled passwords were algorithmically altered versions of common passwords. This often
made it hard to figure out the original password. Perhaps, the mangled passwords sometimes
seemed more like random passwords which is why they were the only overestimated condition in
the first sample. The new condition &#8220;Predictable&#8221; mimicks the most predictable user alterations.
The resulting passwords consist of a capitalized dictionary word with a predictable suffix, e.g.
&#8216;123&#8217; or &#8216;!&#8217;. There were 12 predefined suffixes, and they were randomly appended to the dictionary
word.

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Tuning Password Generation</span></span>
After realizing that virtually no passwords had received a score of 5 in the first sample, I fine-tuned
the generation of passphrases and random passwords. Passphrases were now either two or three
words. Separators (e.g. a dash &#8220;-&#8221;) were inserted in between the words. Random passwords used to
be ten characters long in version 1. In version two their length is also randomized between 7 and 15
characters. This leads to a higher variety of zxcvbn scores. The resulting passwords sometimes
resemble the mangled condition, which is a greater challenge for the players. Moreover, we
increased the likelihood of common passwords from the top 100 by a factor of two.
All measures resulted in a much more diverse spectrum of scores as shown in Figure
5.8.

The players&#8217; achieved score (<span

a player rated as many passwords as possible without spending much thought on the
strength, they still achieved a high score, albeit not a high accuracy. Therefore, the accuracy
is now used as a &#8220;penalty&#8221; by multiplying the achieved score with the accuracy (e.g.

adequately. Furthermore, the players had to figure out why their ratings deviated from the
zxcvbn scores on their own. Now, the feedback screen contains a small indication as to
how the score was calculated. This enables players to improve their score in the next
game.

that had generated data in all conditions in their first game (see Figure 5.10). As before, the
deviations from the zxcvbn scores differed significantly across conditions in version 1

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x003C;</span>&#x00A0;0.008 for version 1. For
version 2, the situation is not as clear, because the sample is smaller (724 observations). The
significantly different pairs were Mangled-Common, Mangled-Passphrase, Mangled-Predictable,
Mangled-Random, Passphrase-Common, Passphrase-Predictable, Passphrase-Random <span

The lack of significant pairwise comparisons is also visible in Figure 5.10b: The users&#8217; ratings did
not deviate much from the zxcvbn score in both the Common and the Random condition, which
explains this result. In other words, mangled and predictable passwords, as well as passphrases
caused the players the most trouble, so their accuracy in these three conditions differed
significantly. <hr class="figure"><div class="figure"

 id="x1-1530005.4.1"></a>Players&#8217; Overall Performance</h4>
<!--l. 270--><p class="noindent" >Overall, we can attest players a fairly good performance. This assessment resounds to Ur et al.&#8217;s
results <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">338</a>]</span>. Players performed best in the &#8220;Common&#8221; condition, i.e. they can identify commonly
used passwords with high certainty. Algorithmically mangled &#8211; but common! &#8211; passwords caused a
bit more trouble. The fact that this was the only condition where people judged strength as too
high reveals the users&#8217; mental model: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">if one substitutes individual letters with digits and</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">symbols, the password must become stronger</span>. The additional data for version 1 helped
narrow down the confidence intervals and moving closer to the &#8220;actual truth&#8221;. After about
one year, the average rating for mangled passwords had moved closer to the zxcvbn
score (compare Figures 5.5 and 5.10a). Perhaps this means that the players that followed
(<span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">&#x0394;(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">) = 70</span>) had a better mental model of the implications of character substitutions. However,
since none of the other average ratings changed significantly, the shift might be due to
chance.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1540005.4.2"></a>Strength Perception vs. Selection</h4>
<!--l. 273--><p class="noindent" >Users rarely rate the strength of passwords. The only notable instance where this is the case, users
see passwords that are shared with them. There is growing evidence that shared passwords are
typically weak <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHaque2014Hierarchy">154</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#XWeirich2001PrettyGoodPersuasion">364</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">385</a>]</span>: Sharing passwords is easier if it is a regular
dictionary word, with predictable suffixes, like <span 
class="ectt-1200">Ferrari123</span>. It would be extremely
cumbersome to dictate a password like <span 
class="ectt-1200">8zJ,uwD&#8217;dXBTUVub </span>over the phone, especially if the
other person needs it urgently. As a consequence, passwords shared with users might
affect their strength ratings. However, we did not observe this in our data: The conditions
that contained regular words were deemed weak. Ur et al.&#8217;s findings point in the same
direction.
<!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" >We can safely assume that users in our sample know that common passwords are weak,
and they are misguided by character substitutions. We believe that this has immediate
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
implications on their selection behavior: it can be hypothesized that users intentionally pick
weak passwords &#8211; as data breaches reveal time and time again. If they think, a stronger
password is necessary, they mangle weak passwords and overestimate the security benefits.
Therefore, there is a lesson we can learn here: users do not need feedback on obviously weak
passwords. They <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">do </span>need feedback if they select a predictably altered password. Ur
et al. mention this already in their recent work on password meters <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">337</a>]</span>. However,
many password meters and feedback mechanisms do not yet discourage predictable
mangling.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1550005.4.3"></a>Intuition or Deliberation?</h4>
<!--l. 278--><p class="noindent" >PASDJO players spent 2.45 seconds on average to rate the strength of each password. Which kind
of thinking processes were responsible here? Is it probable that users acted intuitively (System
1) or did the ponder enough to activate System 2 processes? We can find evidence for
both. In their first game, fast players were about as accurate as slow players. For those
players who played multiple games, we used the number of passwords they managed to
rate as weight in regression models. We did this for validity reasons, but, in fact, the
effect was negligible: We ran the tests without the weight and model fit did not change
notably. All this is interesting because fast players were most likely to use <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">heuristics</span>,
or Acquisiti et al. calls them: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mental shortcuts </span>to come to an assessment. Otherwise
they would have been less accurate or slower. This is one piece of evidence that the
time pressure can induce System 1 thinking processes. The slower players on the other
hand obviously had to think harder to estimate password strength; System 2 had to be
activated. In PASDJO v2, zxcvbn scores for passphrases and random passwords were
much more diverse (see Figure 5.8). So, if a fast player wanted to be accurate in these
cases, they needed to rely on two heuristics: <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">are there dictionary words or does it look</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">random? </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">how many characters are in the password</span>. Only then does one have a chance
to assessing strength correctly. For the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">length</span>-heuristic, it is even necessary to count
the characters. We can safely assume that 2.45 are not enough to make the distinction
between a 17 character (average score = 3.9) and a 19 character passphrase (average score:
5.0). For random passwords, it could be feasible to count characters, because scores are
much more predictable(length(7,8)<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x00A0; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2192;</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x00A0;</span>3, length(9,10)<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x00A0; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2192;</span> <span

class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x00A0; </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">&#x2192;</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">&#x00A0;</span>5).
Nonetheless, we maintain the assumption that rough heuristics helped more than analyzing all
features.
<!--l. 284--><p class="noindent" >We can only wonder if the speed of password perception is also associated with selection time &#8211; are
skilled PASDJO-players capable of choosing a password quickly? If users take less time
to sign up to a given service, they might be using mental shortcuts to accomplish the
tasks. There is much evidence that context factors, preferred password, or composition
policy are indeed used as mental shortcuts. Investigating perception speed with selection
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
speed poses new research questions that have not been addressed in the literature as
such.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.4    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1560005.4.4"></a>Changing users&#8217; mental models with PASDJO</h4>
<!--l. 288--><p class="noindent" >The learning curves in Figures 5.6 and 5.9 clearly indicate that players learned assessing password
strength after playing PASDJO. Most notably, players learned to estimate passphrases. Thus, if the
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Authority </span>principle succeeded as a persuasive strategy, this might have influenced the users&#8217; mental
model around passphrases. More generally, this finding shows that mental models of password
strength are not static. If this were the case, PASDJO could be actively utilized to educate users
about password strength, especially passphrases. Persuasive interventions could challenge users to
rate the strength of a passphrase in the opportune moment and then debrief users to
correct their mental model. We created such an intervention with our studies on the
Decoy effect (see chapter 10), which indeed show the predicted influence on mental
models.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.4.5    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1570005.4.5"></a>Limitations</h4>
<!--l. 291--><p class="noindent" >We discussed the most important limitations regarding the methodology in Section 5.2.3.
Therefore, we focus on the limitations in the data and test results in this section.
<!--l. 294--><p class="noindent" >From Figure 5.7, it is evident that most games were played at special events at the university or
at conferences. Therefore, we can safely assume that our sample consists mostly of
students, their peers, and academics. Thus, we must be careful not to expect the same
strength assessment from other user groups or larger populations. Nonetheless, many
players in our one-year trial might not have a background in cybersecurity and thus, we
are confident that the sample still represents a useful cross-section of a diverse enough
population. Plus, the data was collected in the wild, which further increases its ecological
validity.
<!--l. 297--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, version 2 introduced a number of improvements that would have been nice-to-have
already in the earlier version. Still, in the first version, the different conditions were easier to tell
apart. Thus, causal effects are easier to isolate.
<!--l. 300--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the strength ratings in PASDJO are solely based on zxcbn scores. While it is a
state-of-the-art metric (see Section 2.3.3), other metrics might model real-world attacks better in
some situations. For instance, we could have chosen Melicher&#8217;s JavaScript implementation of
neural network strength estimation <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016NeuralNetworks">230</a>]</span>. However, it is more challenging to integrate and also
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
does not map password strength to a scale from 1 to 5, but to a guess number. The same goes for
other estimators. Nonetheless, zxcvbn&#8217;s assessments correlated strongly with the output from PGS.
Therefore, we are confident that zxcvbn is the best tool for the constraints of our game. In the
future, it might be worthwhile use multiple strength metrics to obtain a more differentiated strength
assessment.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.5    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1580005.5"></a>Summary</h3>
<!--l. 303--><p class="noindent" >In this project, we explored password strength perceptions in a novel approach. It had earlier been
shown in surveys that users do not always have an accurate understanding of what contributes to the
strength of a password. Rather than conducting a survey, we implemented a novel password game,
which allows for better randomization of the measurements. Moreover, the game has unique
potential to measure learning effects of the players. The source code of PASDJO is openly
available<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">7</sup></span><a

so other researchers can adjust the parameters to their own needs. For instance, PASDJO was
customized for a competition as part of a Google-internal event in October 2017.
<!--l. 305--><p class="noindent" >We contribute insights from a longitudinal field study. Our sample comprises more than ten
thousand strength estimations, which allows for accurate analyses. PASDJO players accurately
recognized the strength of commonly used passwords (RQ1). Furthermore, players largely
underestimated the strength of multi-word passphrases, so this was the most error-prone password
topology (RQ2). However, if they went on to play multiple games, they adjusted their mental model
and rated such passphrases higher. This clearly demonstrates learning effects induced by playing
PASDJO. Users were also misled by leet (l33t) substitutions in otherwise predictable
passwords, so they slightly overestimated their strength. However, all in all, players
performed better than anticipated. Perhaps, educational efforts from the past decades
have somewhat paid off, which brings us back to our initial motivation and research
objectives: The folk model of a &#8220;naive&#8221; user seems wrong. Current password meters and
similar feedback systems thus might fail to persuade users because the information they
provide is redundant or well-known. Therefore, we posit that feedback on password
accomodate the fact that people often act deliberately and rationally. For instance, if service
providers aim to persuade users to create a unique passphrase, the benefits need to be more
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">salient </span>and made <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">available</span>. Passphrases are a feasible alternative for master passwords
in password managers, therefore we believe that persuasive techniques are viable for
them.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">5.5.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1590005.5.1"></a>Future Work</h4>
<!--l. 308--><p class="noindent" >The game can be used as-is to answer additional research questions. For example, it would be very
interesting to measure how much playing PASDJO influences actual password selection.
To measure this, participants could be invited to a user study in the lab with a cover
story. Once arrived, they are asked to sit in the waiting area until the experimenter picks
them up again. PASDJO is installed as a demo in the waiting area and there could be a
monetary incentive to &#8220;beat the highscore&#8221;. Afterwards, they complete a usability test where
the focus is steered away from the sign-up form. In such a study setting, it should be
possible to measure password selection under PASDJO&#8217;s short term influence. To study the
influence in the wild, the game could be reduced and made part of an oboarding process to a
password manager. If necessary, one could think of another cover story, e.g. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">please wait</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">while we set up your system, you can distract yourself with this tiny game while you</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">wait</span>.
<!--l. 310--><p class="noindent" >The game can also evolve in the near future. For instance, players could be taken through a few trial
passwords to make sure everyone has the same understanding of the task. To incentivize
participation, additional game elements like challenges and quests are thinkable. Allowing players
to set up profiles serves the <span

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >In the previous chapter, we reached the conclusion that users&#8217; mental models of password strength
are fairly accurate with small exceptions. We can thus expect that users at least try to
create strong passwords if they deem the account worth protecting. However, this is
only one side of the medal: password reuse is rampant. Coping with the high number of
passwords by reusing them is common, but hard to defend against - in part because some
degree of reuse is necessary <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">117</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XZhangKennedy2016RevisitingPasswordRules">385</a>]</span>. At the same time, password reuse might expose
users to an even greater risk than weak passwords. Password reuse renders the security
advantages of picking a very strong password void. In case an attacker obtains a user&#8217;s
plain text password, they gain access to all accounts that share this strong password.
Studies have shown that users tend to underestimate the risks generated by password reuse
<span id="textcolor15"><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">@ref</span></span>.
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent" >As explained in Section 3.3.1, password composition policies are one of the interventions targeted
at weak passwords. However, in many cases users fulfill requirements in predictable ways; the
primary goal is thus missed. So, if password policies do not always help password strength,
they might still prevent password reuse: if they were heterogeneous across different
web sites with mutually exclusive requirements, users cannot reuse passwords like they
would naturally do. In this chapter, we investigate password policies of one hundred of
the most-visited web-services in Germany and try to find how well their differences
prevent password reuse. Some results of this investigation have been previously published
together with Manuel Hartman, Jakob Pfab, and Samuel Souque <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSeitz2017PoliciesReuse">284</a>]</span>. In this chapter
we shed light on the findings and discuss them in the context of supporting password
authentication.
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1620006.1"></a>Background and Context</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent" >Password reuse is a major threat because it is easy for attackers to compromise many accounts at
once. Even if users try to slightly modify their base password, attackers are still able to crack a
large portion of the resulting passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XDas2014TangledWeb">68</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XJaeger2016AnalysisOfLeaks">175</a>]</span>. There is mixed evidence about the subset of
passwords that are reused more often, but generally one can identify a &#8220;go-to password&#8221; for regular
sites, &#8220;high-value passwords&#8221; for important sites, and a &#8220;don&#8217;t care&#8221; password for the rest
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XBailey2014StatisticsReuse">18</a>,&#x00A0;<a

href="#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">359</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >Password policies were originally designed to combat weak passwords, but some of them try to
steer users away from reused passwords. Usually, this is done through black lists that block
passwords that have already been exposed after a data breach. If a user tried to reuse a password
which has been leaked, the system can detect this and enforce the creation of a new one.
However, Habib et al. showed that users perform predictable alterations to circumvent the
black-list filter <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>]</span>. In total, they identified 13 modification techniques. For instance,
participants in the study added digits, symbols, words or letters. Habib et al. conclude that
blacklists are thus only useful, if a user&#8217;s second attempt does not obviously reuse the
blacklisted word. Segreti et al. evaluated a different approach to combat reuse, known as
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
the &#8220;Popularity is Everything&#8221; system <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSegreti2017AdaptivePolicies">281</a>]</span>. Here, a password becomes blacklisted
after a certain number of users have used the same password. Reuse in this case means
reused by many users, instead of a single individual reusing the credentials multiple
times.
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >In most cases, it is impossible to display the full list of blacklisted words in the user interface. Thus,
to find out a site&#8217;s policy, it has to be reverse engineered by testing different passwords and look if
they are acceptable or not. Florêncio and Herley audited policies of public institutions and
high-traffic website <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">113</a>]</span>. They found that online retailers have much looser password policies than
government or university sites. Wang and Wang similarly checked the policies of 50 representative
websites <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XWang2015EmperorsPolicies">357</a>]</span>. They took passwords from leaked datasets and picked 16 passwords with
varying hypothetical strength. They did not aim to identify black-lists or special forbidden
character types. Carnavalet and Mannan managed to automate dictionary checks by
leveraging keep-alive connections <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">49</a>]</span>. However, they focused on server-side strength
estimations rather than blacklists per se. To conduct research on policies in the wild, it would
be favorable to have a repository that contains all policies. Steves et al. proposed to
do crowd-source the data and define a formal language (based on XML) to describe
policies <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSteves2015PasswordPolicyLanguage">309</a>]</span>. The idea was later picked up and extended by Horsch et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHorsch2016PasswordPolicyMarkup">166</a>]</span>. The
repository would also be useful for a password generator that takes the site&#8217;s policy into
account to avoid rejected passwords. On the other hand, adversaries benefit from the
policy repository, too. They could optimize guessing attacks by removing unnecessary
guesses.
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent" >In summary, a password policy would ensure users pick adequately strong passwords and at the
same time prevent dangerous reuse. Estimating the risk is still an open challenge. As of now, there
have not been investigations into the efficacy to prevent reuse among current in-the-wild policies.
Finding out whether current policies were suitable to combat password reuse as a whole was our
primary objective.
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >
<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">6.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1630006.2"></a>Method</h3>
<!--l. 25--><p class="noindent" >Studying password policies needs to address two central aspects: selecting representative web sites
and selecting appropriate passwords. The first part is relatively straight-forward. We took
Alexa.com rankings as indicator for the popularity of a website. To accomplish the analysis in
a reasonable time frame, we took 100 web sites (100% more than Wang and Wang,
and 33% more than Florêncio and Herley). In May 2016, from the 100 most visited
web sites in Germany, 83 allowed public online registrations. The remaining 17 sites
were banks, mobile carriers, or pay-tv providers who require offline registration and
verification as a security measure. The websites and their policies are listed in Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>
(Appendix). Although we took the most-visited websites in Germany, the results have
implications for an international audience, because many of the audited sites operate
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
globally.
<!--l. 27--><p class="noindent" >The second challenge is finding suitable passwords to reverse-engineer password requirements. We
approached this task in two separate stages to find a good candidate set.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1640006.2"></a>First Stage: Identification of suitable passwords</h5>
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Similar to Wang and Wang, we crafted 15 passwords showing typical password characteristics. The
passwords followed common policy categories as proposed by Shay et al. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2016DesigningPasswordPolicies">291</a>]</span>. For instance, some
passwords met a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">3class12 </span>policy by including three different character classes (lower-/uppercase
letters, digits) and a minimum length of 12. Next, we tried to register new accounts with
all of these 15 passwords at all 83 websites. In case the site rejected the password, we
investigated the reasons and modified the password until the policy was fulfilled. This new
password was then added to our test set. During this stage, a number of sites revealed
blacklisted symbols. If this was the case, we intentionally crafted a password with the
blacklisted characters and added it to our set, so that we could se if other websites implicitly
utilize the same blacklist. Similarly, if there were maximum length enforcements, we
added a password longer than that to our list. This process resulted in a test set of <span

diverse passwords<span id="textcolor16"><span

Eleven web sites (13.3%) specifically require at least two different character types (<span

However, Ikea requires letters and digits, but would not count a symbol towards the two character
classes. We still opted to categorize this as a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">2class </span>policy (see remark in footnote 1). <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Complex</span>
policies in the wild have further restrictions, e.g. dictionary checks or special rules. 23 websites
(27.7%) used a dictionary check. Bahn.de demanded three <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">different </span>characters, i.e. a password like
<span 
class="ectt-1200">annnna </span>would be rejected, but <span 
class="ectt-1200">banana </span>would not. Paypal.com disallowed using the same character
three times in a row, which rejects a couple of German compounds like <span 
class="ectt-1200">Schifffahrt</span>.
Nevertheless, it is easy to find a password that fulfills the complexity requirements of
all 83 websites: &#8220;D.ssertation18&#8221; is a 4class password that would pass all complexity
requirements.

Wikipedia, which is also in the top 10, had a minimum length of one character. Interestingly, two
tech-oriented websites allowed the same (heise.de and chip.de). Perhaps the service providers
expect their technical audience to create stronger passwords anyhow, and they do also not much
personal information. We were surprised that 40 sites (48.2%) imposed a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">maximum </span>length
restriction, which is counterproductive in terms of password security. The average maximum length
was <span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">M </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 43 </span>characters (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">SD </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 32</span>). Ten websites rejected passwords longer than 20 characters, so a
number of passphrases would be excluded.
<!--l. 65--><p class="noindent" >In order to effectively prevent password re-use, the maximum length on one site would need to be
lower than the minimum length of another site. This was not the case in any permutation of policy
pairs. The closest difference was the maximum length at ikea.de (10 characters) and the minimum
length at yahoo.com (9 characters). Thus, only a nine or ten character password could be reused on
all the tested websites. <hr class="figure"><div class="figure"

<!--l. 74--><p class="noindent" >Although the websites at the top of the table, i.e. Google, Facebook, Amazon, all use a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic </span>policy,
there is still a high chance that they reject passwords containing certain characters. We found it was
common to disallow non-ASCII symbols (see Table 6.1). For instance, Google rejected any
passwords with non-ASCII characters. So, even dictionary words that include letters from
non-English alphabets, e.g. the German umlauts ä,ö, and ü, will be rejected in this case.
Some sites already provide a list of characters that are either allowed or disallowed at
registration time. In the case of mobile.de, the list of allowed symbols is even smaller. On the
positive side of the spectrum, twitter.com accepted even extended Unicode characters like
emojis.
<!--l. 76--><p class="noindent" >A few websites did not reveal the list of allowed non-ASCII characters; some of our passwords
were blocked if they contained certain characters. Thus, we had to remove character by
character to find out which of them was blacklisted. For regular users, this process would be
exceptionally tedious if their password contained a character from an unknown blacklist. Our
audit shows that spaces and the tilde character &#8216;~&#8217; are the most likely culprits in this
situation, which was the case at netflix.com, spiegel.de or welt.de. Finally, there were
mutually exclusive policies: Lidl.de proactively shows a list of symbols from which the
user has to choose at least one to create an account. However, all those symbols were
disallowed on at least one other website. In that sense, in the unlikely case that a user&#8217;s
main password is accepted at lidl.de, chances are that it is rejected at a couple of other
websites.

albeit a high one in most cases. Shorter passwords are easier to guess in an offline attack. It is
therefore almost necessary to lock out users after a number of failed login attempts to at least
mitigate targeted online-guessing (see Section 2.2). Blocking non-ASCII characters further
impedes users&#8217; password selection. Although the reasons for doing so are anything but obvious &#8211;
allowing more characters increases the theoretical password space and thus potentially security, we
interpret this restriction as a usability precaution. ASCII characters are part of virtually all
physical keyboard layouts, but extended alphabets are not. For instance, if a German user&#8217;s
email password were &#8220;<span 
class="ectt-1200">Die</span><span 
class="ectt-1200">Ärzte123</span>&#8221;, they would be troubled to log into their account
from a PC while abroad, because the umlauts are missing on the keyboard. Of course,
there are ways to enter such characters, but they require much more effort under these
circumstances. The user experience of the entire login process would suffer, which is the
reason for blocking the characters in the first place. However, with the increasing number
of personal mobile devices that also work abroad, the motivation to block non-ASCII
characters crumbles. Artificially blocking non-alphanumeric ASCII symbols, like <span 
class="ectt-1200">$ </span>or
<span 
class="ectt-1200">;</span>, in any case creates unnecessary burden for users. As we have seen in the previous
Chapter, users attribute password strength to such symbols and forbidding them can lead to
confusion and erroneous mental models. Perhaps the restriction was introduced to prevent
site vulnerabilities, e.g. SQL injections. But this is a premier example for a misguided
security approach that shifts effort to millions of users rather than to a couple of security
engineers.

<!--l. 88--><p class="noindent" >Neither length, nor complexity requirements were heterogeneous enough to prevent password
reuse. In the end, only artificial character-class restrictions narrowed down the list of passwords
that can be used everywhere. We found that a nine or ten character password, that includes at least
one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit would have been accepted by 82 of the 83
tested web sites. To circumvent dictionary checks, it is recommendable to intersperse digits in the
middle. Thus, if users pick a password like <span 
class="ectt-1200">s1lverPWD</span>, current in-the-wild policies do not stand
in their way. With an edit distance of 1, many rejected passwords can be turned into
an accepted password if the rejection was caused by a special character. However, the
criteria for the most-reusable password (we can call it the &#8220;golden password&#8221;) are very
well-defined and narrow. Any password that does not meet these criteria will generate usability
issues for users, e.g. if they use longer passwords or ones with a richer character set.
Password generation is hampered in many cases by length limitations. In that sense, policies
help to prevent re-use of passwords that could be considered either exceptionally weak,
or stronger than average. Reuse of &#8220;normal&#8221; passwords that work everywhere is not
prevented.
<!--l. 91--><p class="noindent" >As a consequence, a policy could be adjusted dynamically if the users signs up with a &#8220;golden
password&#8221;. It is very likely that a password showing the above described characteristics is reused
across many web sites. As Florêncio et al. pointed out, this is not necessarily a bad thing <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2014PasswordPortfoliosFiniteUser">117</a>]</span>.
However, if a high-value password is reused for an unimportant account, this interference could
lead to problems. Stobert showed that experts are less prone to this threat <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XStobert2015ExpertPassword">313</a>]</span>, but regular users
cannot always estimate the importance of an account up front. As a consequence, dynamically
adjusting the policy could be a solution. Alternatively, it might be feasible to more prominently
warn users about reuse and explain the implications. As shown by Ur et al., showing alternatives
can help in this situation.

<!--l. 94--><p class="noindent" >Our data clearly shows that generating random passwords can become troublesome for users: many
policies restrict the length and allowed characters. Although many password generators allow the
users to adjust some parameters of password creation (like Apple&#8217;s system shown in Figure 3.4),
more effort is required to find the right parameters. Thus, a system designed to take away cognitive
effort becomes effortful once more. A better solution is to use contextual information for password
generation. Typically, password managers have built-in generators. To avoid that users have to
adjust parameters, a password manager could automatically retrieve the policy for a given website
(context) and generate a strong password that fulfills it. As a proof of concept, we built a web-based
prototype that demonstrates how contextual policy information can be used for password
generation<span class="footnote-mark"><sup class="textsuperscript">3</sup></span><a

<!--l. 103--><p class="noindent" >Although the data can be very useful for password generators and for the design of future
composition policies, it is limited in some ways. First, the list of web sites is not comprehensive, we
merely observed a tiny snapshot of the high-traffic websites, which already required days of work
for the entire team. We also could have investigated the top websites in different categories to get
an even more representative sample. However, the current dataset already depicts the state of affairs
in reasonable detail, and is comparable to similar publications <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFlorencio2010WhereDoPoliciesComeFrom">113</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XWang2015EmperorsPolicies">357</a>]</span>. Furthermore, the longest
password in our test set had a length of 246 characters. We concluded that there is no length
restriction if this password was accepted by a given website, but there might just be a higher
restriction. Nevertheless, since only a fraction of users use passwords this long, this limitation has
almost no consequences.
<!--l. 110--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, for several reasons we did not include emojis in all our tests although they are in fact
part of the unicode character set. First, emojis break some input fields, because most
of them are encoded with 4 bytes instead of 2. This means that they show up as two
characters in the input field, which distorts length requirements. Furthermore, not all
websites were encoded in the extended UTF32 standard and hence failed to submit the
data.
<!--l. 113--><p class="noindent" >Lastly, password policies change over time. Since carrying out our research in May 2016, we found
by randomly re-sampling policies that they have changed. For instance, idealo.de used to enforce a
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">complex </span>policy, but they have switched to a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic6 </span>as of January 2018. Therefore, our data has a
limited lifespan. The big players on the list, like Facebook, Google, or Amazon, are slower to
enforce new polices due to the even larger user base and business impact. An automated process
similar to the one from Carnavalet and Mannan <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCarnavalet2014AnalyzingPWStrengthMeters">49</a>]</span> could help validate the data in the
future.

83 of the websites offered public registration, and we could reuse a single password on 82 of them.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
Hence, we were able to answer our main research question &#8220;<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Do password policies prevent</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password reuse?</span>&#8221; with a resounding &#8220;<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">no</span>&#8221;. Thus, we further question the use of strict password
policies as a means to influence password selection. It has been shown that they do not necessarily
lead to stronger passwords. Now we have shown that they also do not prevent reuse. As a
consequence, it would be easier for users if restrictions on password selection were loosened.
Restrictions enforcing a maximum length or a certain set of symbols should be abolished to ensure
universal password generators integrate with the websites. A <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">basic8 </span>policy appears to work
for the major players, so more service providers can follow them. To account for the
potential security vulnerabilities, blacklisted common passwords and adaptive blacklists
are promising solutions <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XHabib2017Blacklists">146</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XSegreti2017AdaptivePolicies">281</a>]</span>. Future research should thus evaluate the specific
blacklists and user support to help them find alternatives in case their password was
blacklisted.

<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Although there are certain patterns, password selection is a task that each individual handles in their
own way. We have shown in chapter 5 that password strength is even subjectively <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">evaluated</span>
differently depending on certain characteristics. Again, while there was an overall tendency, we
were not able to break down the strength ratings by individual differences: was there a
special user group who performed better than others in the game? What characterizes
this user group? Moreover, our previous chapter shed light on password policies in the
wild. In a few notable cases, the rules were challenging and reject a substantial part
of passwords. Users have developed strategies to cope with rejected passwords, but it
would be interesting to know the exact factors that contribute to their behavior in these
circumstances. Egelman and Peer make a strong argument that there is no &#8220;average
user&#8221; so it is necessary to look at individual differences to understand user behavior
<span class="cite">[<a

A LastPass report more roughly divides password usage into two groups <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XLastPass2016PersonalitiesGetUsHacked">207</a>]</span>: Type A users want
to stay in control and are driven to act securely, so they developed an elaborate system that they
perceive as suitable. Type B users do not believe that their accounts are valuable to attackers, so
they do not prioritize security over usability. Those two taxonomies stem from analysis of
user-selected passwords, i.e. a retrospective evaluation. However, predictive approaches are
under-explored. For instance, if a user is generally an emotional person, does this impact their
password selection strategies? If a user is diligent in real life, do they invest effort to diligently craft
passwords, too?
<!--l. 23--><p class="noindent" >In a series of user studies we explored the associations between personality traits and passwords. If
such associations exist, a new range of support systems opens that are tailored to a user&#8217;s

carried out in cooperation with three students. In each separate project we focused on a different

<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >Our primary goal was to find ways to predict password behavior from personality traits. At this
point, the discourse about risky passwords included personality factors as explanatory variables.
However, only few empirical studies had been carried out to challenge the assumptions. We aimed
to provide such empirical data and a discussion of the implications on the design of password
policies and password authentication systems. For instance, adjusting requirements of password
policies depending on the user&#8217;s personality promises to reduce frustration of password
selection. Thus, our over-arching research question can be framed as &#8220;<span

<!--l. 57--><p class="noindent" >However, apart from such conscious behavior, there may be other preconditions that make some
users pick stronger passwords than others. In a large field study, Mazurek et al. found that computer
science and engineering students created passwords that were less guessable than those from
business or politics students <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMazurek2013Measuring">224</a>]</span>. Beyond demographic background, context factors like the
emotional state during password selection have also been investigated. Gulenko examined the effect
of presenting positive textual messages and icons during password selection and found benefits for
the adoption of passphrases <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGulenko2014PasswordsEmotion">144</a>]</span>. In contrast, putting users in a state of cognitive distress or
depletion made participants choose weaker passwords in a large lab study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XGross2016EffectCognitiveEffort">143</a>]</span>. Social
pressure as another type of psychological leverage was investigated by Egelman et al.
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XEgelman2013DoesMyPasswordGoUpToEleven">100</a>]</span>. While they argue that account value plays a superior role for the effectiveness of
password meters, others have shown that the <span

measurable impact on the effort users put into creating a password <span class="cite">[<a

security and privacy. Yet, our understanding of the influence of personality on password
perception and consequently password selection is still low. Our work tries to improve
our understanding about the origin of the differences in users&#8217; judgments of password
strength.

<h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1820007.2"></a>Study 1: Policies</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >We start out with the exploration of psychological factors for the design of password policies. We
were motivated by the fact that at this point, policies are a one-fits-all solution that evidently does
not work in the same ways for all users: Shay et al. observed that subjective usability ratings for
policies differed among participants <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">293</a>,&#x00A0;<a 
href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>]</span>. For instance, about 40% of their participants found
it difficult to create a password under a &#8220;3class16&#8221; policy, but another 40% found it easy <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XShay2014CanLongPasswordsBeSecureAndUsable">295</a>]</span>.
Following the general discourse and related results from privacy research, we hypothesized that an
individual&#8217;s personality might be responsible for their attitudes towards one policy or
another. Therefore, our goal in this project was to explore such associations between
personality traits and policy preference. At this point, we leave out analyses on password
strength.
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">7.2.1    </span> <a 
 id="x1-1830007.2.1"></a>Method</h4>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >Our study was completely exploratory, because the literature did not allow us to derive narrow
hypotheses. Since personality traits are nuanced, we opted for an online survey to collect a larger
sample. Personality was assessed in the Five-Factor Model. We opted for the BFI-K construct by
Rammstedt and John <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XRammstedt2005BFI">258</a>]</span>, because it is freely available in German. Moreover, with its 21 items,
the time to fill out the questionnaire is kept reasonably low. Participants were asked to create
several passwords in a row, i.e. the study followed a within-groups protocol. Here, we evaluated
three different password policies: a traditional (3class12), an uncommon (2word12),
and a novel policy (emoji12) that required the selection of at least one emoji through
a graphical user interface (more on emojis in chapter 11). The reason for this choice
was that the policies are different enough to serve as levels of the independent variable
&#8220;policy&#8221;. Participants assessed the &#8220;difficulty to create&#8221; a password for each policy.
Moreover, we had them rank the policies by their personal preference, so the choice
of 3class12, 2word12, and emoji12 would help them spot and judge the differences
easily.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1840007.2.1"></a>Structure and Tasks</h5>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent" >The study was divided into 3 overall parts. In the first part, participants were briefed about privacy
details of the study and they provided demographic background information. Then they proceeded
to the personality questionnaire before they were asked to perform three experimental tasks. Each
consisted of creating a password and assessing the difficulty with agreement levels on the three
items <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">&#8220;It was difficult to create a password that meets the requirements&#8221;</span>, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">&#8220;I found the password</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">requirements bothersome&#8221;</span>, and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">&#8220;It was easy to create a new password&#8221;</span>. Agreement was
measured on a five-point scale ranging from &#8220;Strongly disagree&#8221; to &#8220;Strongly agree&#8221;.
Inversely keying the items as well double encoding makes the data more robust against
implausible responses. The resulting difficulty-to-create score thus ranges from 3 to
15.
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent" >The order of the policies was counterbalanced to mitigate order effects, we recorded the order as a
control variable. We chose an online-banking scenario for all three selections. The first prompt was
to create a password to protect an online banking account. Secondly, participants were told that
someone had gained access to their account and the bank locked them out. As a security
precaution, they had to reset their first password. The last task description explained that their
password had expired after one year and they need to reset it again. This storyline was
designed to fulfill the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">realistic threat </span>principle proposed by Krol et al. (see Section 3.1.1)
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XKrol2016ExperimentDesign">204</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >We used SosciSurvey, a standard survey tool, to collect the responses. The dynamic parts involving
password selection were embedded in iframes. To match the data from the survey tool and the

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent" >We recruited participants through posts on social networks and by sending out the invitation link in
a university-wide newsletter (more than 5000 recipients). To incentivize participation, we
announced a raffle of five shopping vouchers with a value of 20<span 
class="ptmr8c-x-x-120">&#x20AC; </span>each. At this point, 222 people
had started participation. After drop-out and plausibility checks, the remaining sample size was
<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">N </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 164</span>. As expected, the age distribution was narrow: our sample consisted mostly of students in
their mid-twenties average: 24.7 (SD=5.5). 79 respondents were female, 83 male, and 2 preferred
not to answer. In the background screener, 65 people (40%) indicated to possess formal training in
computer science or information technology. We also requested self-reported assessments on
password behaviors. Here we found that 40% reuse passwords without modification, 32% reuse
them with modifications or with a mnemnoic technique. 17% often create new passwords. In terms
of management strategy, the majority (53%) tries to memorize passwords. 11% use a
password manager or generator. Written cues served as aid for 10% of respondents, and 16%
write passwords down on analog media, while 21% use electronic files. Interestingly, the
distribution of coping strategies is very close to survey findings gathered with more diverse
samples <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XCSID2012PasswordHabits">65</a>]</span>. Hence, we believe to have caught a representative snapshot of password
behavior.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x1-1870007.2.1"></a>Method Limitations</h5>
<!--l. 26--><p class="noindent" >The method, albeit carefully executed, faces a few limitations regarding the interpretability. First,
the sample was fairly homogeneous, because participants were mostly between 20 and 28 years old
and have an academic background. This might reduce statistical power in detecting effects on
personality <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XSrivastava2003PersonalityAdulthood">306</a>]</span>, but on the other hand, this constellation resolves age-related confounding effects.
Moreover, our study was strongly focused on individual preferences and usability perceptions of
different policies, so only a within-groups design was feasible. However, in real-life password
selection, users rarely select three passwords in a row. The choice of our storyline still makes
confident about the ecological validity <span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XFahl2013EcologicalValidityPasswordStudy">104</a>]</span>. The repeated measures design did not
allow us to measure the policies&#8217; influence on password memorability, which we have
to postpone to another study. At this stage, the preference was more valuable for our
exploration than memorability effects. Besides, we briefed participants to fill out the
survey on a desktop PC or a similar device. We cannot guarantee that all participants
followed this instruction, which might have had an effect on their password selection
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="#XMelicher2016UsabilityMobileTextPasswords">229</a>]</span>.
<!--l. 29--><p class="noindent" >Finally, we unfortunately made a mistake in the deployment of the emoji-based policy. Instead of
12 characters, it required participants to select 16 characters beside the emoji. We realized this fact
by looking at descriptive statistics during the course of the study, because the policy
performed significantly worse than the other two. We re-deployed the emoji-based policy
immediately after we had realized the error. Consequently, we had to remove the data for
the creation difficulty and ranking in cases 1-61, reducing the overall sample size to
103. Nonetheless, the sample size is sufficiently large to investigate medium to strong
effects.
