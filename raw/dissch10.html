<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >As laid out in Part <a 
href="disspa2.html#x73-122000II">II<!--tex4ht:ref: part:problem_space --></a>, one dimension of the problem space is that users pick weak passwords. In
many situations, e.g. for unimportant accounts, this is acceptable. However, with rising importance,
the need for a stronger password becomes salient. In these situations, mental models of password
strength (see Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>) play a vital role, because they influence the choice of the password. There
is increasing evidence that mental models about strength are often sub-par: many users
overestimate the strength increase by adding digits and symbols or substituting letters with them
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSeitz2017PASDJO">289</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2016PerceptionsPassword">342</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>. Thus, our goal is to avoid risky practices originating from flawed mental models.
In this research project, we try to steer users away from weak passwords by providing more secure
alternatives. Since it is hard to compete against a user’s preferred password choice, we try to
leverage persuasive strategies from marketing to “sell” the stronger alternative. This strategy
is the so-called decoy effect. Given a range of products, vendors use this technique to
make the one item stand out that is best for them (and often for the client). A decoy
choice architecture includes one item that is “unattractive by design” to make a superior
option salient. In numerous studies, it successfully shifted prospective buyers’ reference
point and achieved its intentions. Thus, we aimed to translate it to the decision-making
problem of selecting passwords. In essence, we can craft password suggestions in such a
way that one of the suggestions is more attractive in terms of its strength and usability
benefits.
</p><!--l. 7--><p class="noindent" >We thus aimed to answer the following research questions:
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">How can we translate the decoy choice architecture to password selection?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Does the decoy effect make users select stronger passwords?
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">What are the opportunities and pitfalls in this approach?</li></ul>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent" >To that end, we conducted an online experiment where different groups of participants received
variations of password suggestions. This chapter reports on the design and evaluation
of a novel persuasive strategy and discusses the implications for its future application
areas.

<!--l. 41--><p class="noindent" >Our project is positioned in a line of work that tries to nudge users towards strong passwords (see
Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1060003.4">3.4<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:persuasive-interventions --></a>). We approach this problem through two main components: suggestions and choice
architecture. We briefly provide context on these two elements.

<!--l. 47--><p class="noindent" >Suggesting passwords was at the heart of the first work on persuasion for stronger passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>]</span>.
We can identify three common patterns here: (I) trying to get users to accept a suggested
password verbatim <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVance2013FearAppeals">347</a>]</span>; (II) suggesting alterations or insertions based on their own
password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XForget2008ImprovingPasswordsThroughPersuasion">126</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XSegreti2017AdaptivePolicies">285</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2015SpoonfulOfSugar">300</a>]</span>; or (III) suggesting a random password that merely serves as a
basis for the user’s password <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XHuha2015UserReplaceablePasswords">170</a>]</span>. All password generators fall into the first category
because they encourage users to make sure the string is completely random. The second
approach is the most common and most evaluated of the three and has seen mixed results
overall. Approach (III) seems promising in environments with critical security levels
requiring more stringent policies. Moreover, suggestions are sometimes included in real-time
feedback where they can act as feed-<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">forward </span>(opposed to feed<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">back</span>) <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2017DataDrivenPWMeter">341</a>]</span>. In summary,
suggestions are an essential part of the persuasive toolkit and offer a wide range of new design
opportunities.

<!--l. 50--><p class="noindent" >The decoy effect was discovered through research in consumer psychology. Buying a product
usually involves deciding between different alternatives. On a high level, products are easily
comparable by their quality and price, so customers heavily rely on these two metrics. These two
dimensions also build the foundation of the decoy effect. In one of the first experiments on
“asymmetric dominance”, Huber et al. illustrate decision-making processes with a simple example
to decide between six-packs of beer that differ in price and quality <span class="cite">[<a

Buyers may have a general preference for either lower price, or higher quality if all other factors are
excluded. Imagine the vendor wants to sell more of beer (A) because margins are higher for that
product. To achieve this, Huber et al. explored different ways of adding a third option:

<!--l. 70--><p class="noindent" >Product (C) is as expensive as (A) but falls behind in quality. Thus, buyers will make a “better deal”
if they choose option (A) by comparison with (C). Options (B) and (C) are more difficult to
compare because both dimensions (price and quality) are higher in (B) and make it appear like an
outlier. Option (C) is thus called the <span

(the <span

boosts the favorability of the target. This is exactly what Huber et al. found, and which was
later confirmed numerous times in different decision-making scenarios <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAriely1995ExplanationSubjectiveDominance">14</a>]</span>. Adding the
decoy has the potential to reverse existing preferences, making it a powerful tool for
marketing and sales. The decoy itself often serves the sole purpose of making another item
stand out, i.e. the vendor does not intend to sell the decoy item. Thus, the underlying
persuasion principles are <span

class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">framing</span>. Constructing the dimensions in a certain

strategy.
</p><!--l. 72--><p class="noindent" >Huber et al. stated that there is a specific combination of attributes to position the decoy (see Figure
<a 
href="#x106-310001r1">10.1a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:general-construction --></a>). Depending on the target, the decoy acts as range increasing (R, R*), frequency increasing
(F), or both (RF). By extending the range on the dimension on which the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">competitor </span>is superior,
the fixed difference between all items on that dimension is weighed less. Figure <a 
href="#x106-310002r2">10.1b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:beer-construction --></a>
illustrates this type of decoy placement for the sixpack example. The range of the quality is
clearer after the decoy is added: before, the span was 50-70, and afterward 40-70. The
superiority of the competitor appears less significant. Hence, the higher price can appear
unjustified.

 id="x106-31100010.1.2"></a>Example: Decoy Effects in the Real World</h5>
<!--l. 99--><p class="noindent" >Huber et al.’s example has often been adapted and used in the design of user interfaces. The vendor,
i.e. a service provider, tries to steer users towards a particular direction that they see as
favorable. For instance, location settings on an Android device show signs of a decoy pattern
(see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). From bottom to top, the “device only” mode activates the GPS module
to determine the device’s location. It is thus highly accurate outside of buildings but
does not work well inside. On the other hand, the “battery saving mode” works in both
environments by using Google’s online location services based on triangulation between
network cells and surrounding WiFis. In urban areas and even inside buildings, it can
achieve great accuracy, while it only roughly estimates locations in rural areas. The two
accuracy-levels are thus comparable, but the “battery saving mode” does not require powering up
additional antennae and modules, giving it a graspable advantage. The “high accuracy”
mode combines both approaches and is thus the most battery consuming, but also the
most versatile option. “Battery saving” can be seen as the target, because it provides
the best trade-off in most situations. The “device only” mode is the decoy because it
uses more battery, while the “high accuracy” mode is the competitor. Google requires
the user to allow the collection of technical sensor data for the “high accuracy” and
“battery saving” mode. Battery consumption is likely more important to users than location
accuracy, which further suggests that the “battery saving” mode is indeed the targeted
setting.

<!--l. 114--><p class="noindent" >The <a 
href="dissli3.html#glo:USEC">USEC</a> community has started to investigate the feasibility of behavioral economics principles
in the design of security and privacy mitigations. Egelman et al. showed that choice architecture is
highly relevant for privacy settings on mobile devices <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XEgelman2013ChoiceArchitecture">93</a>]</span>. They explored how users value
privacy-respecting apps and how they make decisions from a list of applications. To measure
preferences, they put monetary values and discounts on permissions like accessing the
Internet or using device location. Participants in their study showed clear decision-making
patterns that were influenced by the price and type of permission. Therefore, Egelman et al.
concluded that a certain choice architecture can guide users towards a more “rational
behavior”.
</p><!--l. 116--><p class="noindent" >Knijnenburg et al. <span class="cite">[<a

class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">choice proliferation </span>phenomenon in location-privacy settings.
The principle indicates that people become choice averse with an increasing number of options. In
their study, they observed that participants were strongly influenced by the number of available
options to share their location. Without specifically mentioning it, they also used a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">decoy </span>option
that was extremely unfavorable but triggered a change in preference. In another study, Korff and
Böhme showed that the granularity of privacy settings on a business social network
can have similar effects: participants in their study tended to stick with default settings
and were also less satisfied with their choices if there were too many options <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKorff2014TooMuchChoice">201</a>]</span>.
Acquisiti et al. showed that such architectures can nudge users towards certain settings
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XAcquisti2017NudgesPrivacySecurity">1</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 118--><p class="noindent" >Regarding passwords, only a few publications mention the use of choice architectures. Renaud et
al. evaluated a wide range of nudges to make users of a university platform pick a stronger
password. They concluded that the tested architectures were fairly ineffective in achieving this goal,
but there might have been other more effective solutions beyond their designs. Before
our investigation, no study that we are aware of has explored the decoy paradigm for
passwords.

<!--l. 127--><p class="noindent" >We aimed to craft a nudge that persuades users to create stronger passwords. Respecting the
principle of the opportune moment, we opted for account creation contexts. To emulate a situation
that is comparable to buying one out of several product alternatives, we show suggestions beneath
the password field where the user enters their choice (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). We ended up with this design
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
after identifying opportunities for strength feedback on the user’s password and on the
suggestions (i.e. feed-forward). To that end, we had created several prototypical choice
architectures and rapidly evaluated them in the lab and online (see technical report <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSeitz2016DecoyEffectReport">286</a>]</span>). The
final architecture implements the propositions in Huber et al.’s framework (see Figure

<!--l. 142--><p class="noindent" >The key to password choice architecture is the user’s own password. It has to be seen as the
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">competitor</span>. Service providers will want to accept the user’s own password to make sure users
sign up. On the other hand, they want to avoid attacks on user accounts, which is why
they likely encourage using a stronger password. This is the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">target</span>. In our design, we
opted for a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">passphrase </span>as the target for several reasons: only a few users create secure
passphrases as their primary credentials <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015PWCreationLab">345</a>]</span>; passphrases provide usability and memorability
benefits <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XKeith2009PassphraseDesign">189</a>]</span>; self-selected passphrases often do not provide the desired security benefits
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XBonneau2012LinguisticProperties">37</a>]</span>, which can be mitigated by supplying users with a combination of random words
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XShay2012CorrectHorseBatteryStaple">297</a>]</span>.
</p><!--l. 144--><p class="noindent" >To make the passphrase preferable over the competitor, a decoy needs to be carefully positioned
along the two dimensions such that it is closer to the target than to the competitor. Moreover, it
needs to be dominated at least in one dimension by the target. To achieve this, we identified “ease
of use” and “security benefits” as two feasible dimensions of the choice architecture. We opted for
a range-frequency decoy (see Figure <a 
href="#x106-310001r1">10.1a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:general-construction --></a>) where the target dominates the decoy in <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">both</span>
dimensions because effects are more likely to be detected this way. A typical-length <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">mangled</span>
password fulfills the criteria. The richer character set includes symbols that require the
Shift/Alt keys to enter them. Thus, the ease of creation is lower than that of a passphrase
(dimension 1). At the same time, typical mangling strategies only slightly contribute to
password strength, which we confirmed in Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>. Passphrases are considered stronger by
several estimators. Consequently, mangled passwords are dominated by passphrases
regarding strength (dimension 2). Figure <a 
href="#x106-313002r2">10.5b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:dimensions-prolific --></a> illustrates the positioning along the two
dimensions.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3.1    </span> <a 
 id="x106-31500010.3.1"></a>Method</h4>
<!--l. 156--><p class="noindent" >The study implemented a between groups design. The main task was creating a new password
under one of four treatments. “Suggestion architecture” served as the independent variable with
three levels: <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Passphrase</span>, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Mangled</span>, and <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Decoy</span>. Each level was tested with a separate participant
group. In the Passphrase condition, participants were suggested a single passphrase consisting of
four words. Analogously, a higher-complexity password is displayed in the Mangled condition. The
Decoy group received both the target passphrase and the complex decoy password as alternative
suggestions to their own password. Including study conditions with single suggestions allowed us
to compare different choice architectures and measure the impact of the decoy effect. All
suggestions are accompanied by visual and textual representations of zxcvbn scores
(see Figure <a 
href="#x106-313002r2">10.5b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:dimensions-prolific --></a>). The labels for the different strength scores were <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">very weak, weak,</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">ok, strong, very strong</span>. To obtain a baseline for comparison, there were no password
suggestions for the <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Control </span>group. However, participants in this group also received the same
kind of strength feedback, so we could isolate the impact of adding suggestions, i.e.
feedforward.
</p><!--l. 159--><p class="noindent" >We did not collect plaintext passwords to ethically deal with participants disclosing
their real passwords. Instead, we modified the zxcvbn library by stripping all sensitive
information<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss107.html#fn1x35"><sup class="textsuperscript">1</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x106-315001f1"></a>,
and analyzed participants’ passwords on the fly. These <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">meta statistics </span>served as dependent variables
and were saved to a database. Most notably, they describe the password topology (length, number
of upper-/lowercase, digits, symbols, and chunks), estimated guess numbers and the zxcvbn score.
Scores range from 0 (weak) to 4 (strong), while guess number estimates are open-end. Another
dependent variable was memorability which was measured by a successful authentication three
days after password selection. To achieve this, we hashed passwords with a secure one-way
function (PHP’s <span 
class="ectt-1200">password_hash()</span>) and compared hashes afterward. If they matched, the
password was correct. Thus, this is a binary metric.

</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x106-31600010.3.1"></a>Prototype</h5>
<!--l. 162--><p class="noindent" >For the study, we implemented the concept as web-prototype based on HTML and JavaScript.
As a foundation for generating passwords in all conditions, we relied on the Diceware
dictionary<span class="footnote-mark"><a 
href="diss108.html#fn2x35"><sup class="textsuperscript">2</sup></a></span><a 
 id="x106-316001f2"></a>
consisting of 5823 words. It provides a good spectrum of common and uncommon words of
varying length. To generate the passphrase (target), four words were randomly combined, and each
word was capitalized. As shown in Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>, zxcbvn rates four-word passwords with
its highest score. The randomness of generated passwords allows us to calculate their
entropy. Each word has an estimated entropy of <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(</span><span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">log</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">2</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(5823) </span><span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">≈ </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">12 </span>bits. Combining four
words randomly thus results in a total entropy of approximately <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">(2</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">12</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">)</span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-90">4</span> <span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 48 </span>bits for
passphrases.
</p><!--l. 164--><p class="noindent" >For the decoy and the mangled password condition, the prototype modifies a randomly selected
word from a smaller subset of the Diceware list. The subset only includes words longer than eight
characters, giving a total of 687 candidates. The first letter of the word and a second randomly
chosen character are capitalized. Two letters are substituted by similarly-looking digits to inspire a
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">l33t </span>character. For instance, the letter “o” was replaced with the digit “0”. Finally, a random symbol
and digit are appended to the word. The resulting decoy password consists of four different
character classes (LUDS).
</p><!--l. 166--><p class="noindent" >We anticipated that the generated passwords are exceptionally unattractive in some cases, e.g. if
passphrases include uncommon, hardly memorable words, e.g. <span 
class="ectt-1200">GirthInflixThineAegis</span>. To
make them more appealing, the prototype provides a <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">shuffle </span>button that creates a new combination
of different words (see Figure <a 
href="#x106-313001r1">10.5a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:screenshot-prolific --></a>). The mangled password can also be re-generated.
Another feature to lower the barriers to take one of the suggested passwords was the
opportunity to transfer it to the password field with a single click. However, to facilitate
memorization, participants needed to manually type the password into the confirmation
field.

<!--l. 169--><p class="noindent" >The experiment consisted of two parts that were carried out on separate days. The initial step

Participants were invited to return for the second part of the study three days later. This follow-up
step included memorability assessment and further qualitative feedback to help us interpret the
data.
</p><!--l. 171--><p class="noindent" >The first part started with a thorough briefing about the collected data and asked for consent. The
same web-page introduced the scenario for the task: Participants were asked to imagine creating a
new password for their already existing email account under a basic8 policy. The page
displayed the password fields and suggestions. Participants were randomly assigned to one
of the four treatment groups, so the type and number of suggestions depended on this
assignment. Once the password was successfully confirmed, participants were asked to
fill out a brief questionnaire mostly consisting of 5-point scale items on attitudes and
password behaviors. At the end of the first part, the web-page displayed a confirmation
code that participants had to copy over to the prolific platform to mark the survey as
done.
</p><!--l. 173--><p class="noindent" >Three days later, we invited the participants to return and complete the second part. They were
asked to provide the password they had remembered, but if they failed, they could continue
anyhow.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a

 id="x106-318001f3"></a>,
which is comparable to Amazon’s Mechanical Turk solution. Participants were screened for
age (older than 18 years), and they had to be located in either the UK or in the USA.
The region restriction was introduced because Prolific has a larger user base in those
countries. To ensure the quality of the data, we required a past survey completion rate
of at least 95%. Such rates are a common metric for the reliability of a crowd-worker

<!--l. 186--><p class="noindent" >Through statistical tests, we found significant differences across the groups. Although the decoy
effect did not work as intended, there were notable side-effects. In the following, we
break down the findings. For non-parametric continuous data, we used Kruskal-Wallis
and Mann-Whitney tests, whereas frequencies were analyzed with chi-squared tests.
Significance levels were set to <span

<!--l. 194--><p class="noindent" >Across all treatment groups, nine respondents out of 65 (<span 
class="zptmcm7y-x-x-120">≈ </span>14%) accepted a suggested password
verbatim – four in the Passphrase group, two in the Mangled group, and three in the Decoy group
(two targets, one decoy). Suggestions were thus effective for one in ten participants. From the
remaining 56 self-selected passwords, 18 (27.7%) were weaker than the suggestions. In other
words, the nudge was ineffective for roughly a third of participants judged by their choice to
pick a password that was weaker than the suggestion. For the remaining 38 participants
(58.4%), the nudge could have influenced them to create passwords that are as strong as the
suggestions, but we lack data to investigate this. Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> visualizes the efficacy of suggesting
passwords.

<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a 
 id="x106-32100010.3.2"></a>Impact on Password Strength</h5>
<!--l. 197--><p class="noindent" >Table <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span> lists descriptive statistics on password strength metrics. Taking the entire sample into
account, omnibus tests did not show significant differences between the four groups. However, we
plotted the confidence intervals of all metrics to examine the data visually. Here, it is visible that
guess numbers did notably differ between the groups: the Passphrase treatment led to the strongest
passwords overall (see Figure <a 
href="#x106-321002r1">10.8a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:ci-guesses-all --></a>). If we remove the samples where a suggestion was
accepted, the differences become smaller (see Figure <a 
href="#x106-321003r2">10.8b<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:ci-guesses-own --></a>). Since guess numbers are
shown on a logarithmic scale, the difference might appear smaller than it actually is:
guess numbers in the passphrases group were about 50 times higher than in the control
and mangled groups. This is also visible in Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>, where the percentage of cracked
passwords is consistently smaller than in the other groups. Fitting a smoothed generalized
additive model to the cracked percentages confirms that passwords are less likely to
be cracked after any given number of guesses if they were created in the Passphrase
condition (<span

most likely is due to increased password length in the Passphrase group, see Figure

classes. Participants in the Mangled condition were about twice as likely to adhere to one of the
complex policies (comp8, 3class12, 3class16) than the Control group. On average, the length
requirement was exceeded by <span

down on paper (1). Participants who had opted for a suggestion were mostly unable to authenticate.
The one respondent in the Decoy group who correctly entered the mangled password in the second

<!--l. 244--><p class="noindent" >A thematic co-analysis of the qualitative data from the exit questionnaires showed that there were
no observable differences across groups. Therefore, we do not report group-specific details but
rather the general picture.
</p><!--l. 246--><p class="noindent" >In the three treatment groups, we elicited data on the subjective perceptions of the suggestions.
Participants were shown adjectives from which they could select multiple items and provide
additional text. The most common reactions were “neutral” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 25</span>), “surprised” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 23</span>) and
“pleased” (<span 
class="zptmcm7m-x-x-120">n </span><span 
class="zptmcm7t-x-x-120">= 11</span>). There was no observable tendency as to perceived security improvements for
email accounts by the suggestions. 20 participants (24%) might be annoyed if their main
email provider implemented a sign-up form like the one in the study, but they did not
clarify this further. 30 respondents (36%) acknowledged that suggestions could facilitate
email account creation. The main reason to decline the suggestions was the need for
passwords with personal meanings (43% agreement rate). Besides, P81 said that “the
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
main reason I don’t use generated passwords, is that if a hacker finds out how they’re
generated, they’ve basically figured everyone’s passwords out. Then its only a matter of time
before they brute force into accounts using the same method the system uses to generate
them.” This quote highlights the distrust regarding password generators, while at the same
time assuming attackers are incapable of predicting human behavior. Finally, there were
interesting qualitative statements about the memorability of passwords (all <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">sic</span>): “sorry, i
would have written it down if i knew there was a second part to the study. thats what i do
for passwords that i will use again, until i memorize it, then i throw away the paper i
write it on.” (P33, <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">sic</span>) “I’m not sure if it was because I don’t type this password I used
here often or if it [is] because I used one of my lesser very weak passwords that I failed
to remember it quickly. Regardless, I need a few better habits. ” (P26) “I forgot my
password as I didn’t think I’d need it again. Had I known I would likely have tried harder to
remember it.” (P47). From these statements, we take away three important points: a) Some
participants were unaware that they would need the password in the future although they
received according instructions, b) they rely on their own memorization techniques,
and c) they feel guilty of bad password habits which echoes the results in Chapter <a 
href="dissch8.html#x98-2470008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:mental_models_pwm --></a>.
In summary, those factors had contributed to the low memorability rates of the study
passwords.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.3.3    </span> <a 
 id="x106-32500010.3.3"></a>Limitations</h4>
<!--l. 253--><p class="noindent" >There are a few important aspects to consider in the interpretability of our study findings. The
sampling method, although state of the art, still targets users who are open-minded enough to
participate in studies. Only those crowd-workers with a successful track record were screened in,
thus the sample might not be representative for the entire population. However, rough trends can be
seen in any case. In terms of sample size, we had initially hoped for a larger data set, but
had to omit a significant proportion due to low quality of the data. This reduced the
achievable statistical power, which prevented us to narrow down confidence intervals
and accordingly find significant effects. This limitation is aggravated by the fact that
many study participants chose passwords that were much stronger than what is to be
expected from real-world passwords <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XMazurek2013Measuring">226</a>]</span>. Such behavior reduces ecological validity and
shrinks potential effect sizes induced by different nudges. Despite these limitations,
it is astonishing to still detect notable differences across groups. Finally, we relied on
the zxcvbn strength metric, as in many other studies throughout this thesis. We could
have collected plain-text passwords and used a more robust approach like PGS <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XUr2015MeasuringRealWorldAccuracies">346</a>]</span>.
However, this would have been too risky, because participants might have disclosed their real
email passwords in the scenario, which we regard as unethical. Therefore, the zxcvbn
metrics are one of the best solutions to work around this issue while providing sufficient
robustness.

<!--l. 256--><p class="noindent" >In the following, implications and opportunities from using persuasive suggestions are
highlighted.
</p><!--l. 258--><p class="noindent" >
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.4.1    </span> <a 
 id="x106-32700010.4.1"></a>The Ineffectiveness of the Decoy Effect</h4>
<!--l. 259--><p class="noindent" >The data did not provide any indication that the presence of an additional decoy-suggestion
influenced participants. Therefore, we <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">reject H2 </span>and conclude that the decoy choice
architecture was not effective. There are several explanations about the failure of the
architecture.
</p><!--l. 262--><p class="noindent" >First, in order to induce a decoy effect, the two preferability dimensions (cf. Figure <a 
href="#x106-310001r1">10.1a<!--tex4ht:ref: fig:decoy:general-construction --></a>) need to
be salient and clear, e.g. the price and quality of an item. In our case, the dimensions were <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">ease of</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">password creation </span>and <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">strength</span>. While strength was perhaps effectively conveyed, the user
interface did not explicitly highlight the usability of the password. Advantages in typing speed and
memorability over the mangled password were probably to <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">vague or unclear</span>. The persuasive
strategy failed to trigger deliberate thought processes (cf. System 2), and intuitive thinking
(System 1) might be responsible for participants’ preference to stick to their self-selected
passwords.
</p><!--l. 265--><p class="noindent" >Moreover, Huber et al. measured the decoy effect in a different study design. They relied on
repeated measures to understand preferential shifts induced by the presence – or absence – of the
decoy. For password studies, repeated measures are only seldom a good fit, because users are
unlikely to show different behaviors if they create passwords multiple times in a row. To get closer
to the original study design, a real-world field test is conceivable. When users create an
account, the decoy might be present and it is missing when they reset the password at
any later point in time. As a caveat, this approach vastly increases the duration of the
study.
</p><!--l. 268--><p class="noindent" >Finally, the participants’ self-selected passwords were unexpectedly strong. This did not provide
enough room to nudge them towards an even stronger alternative, because the “price” that it entails
is unreasonably high. As a consequence, the target group for future studies in password suggestions
should be narrowed down to people who are less likely to create a strong password. For
instance, we know that the passwords that users select as teenagers tend to be weak
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
<span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XVonZezschwitz2013SurvivalShortest">354</a>]</span>. At the same time, these are reused very often and are in use for many years. Thus,
teenagers make for an interesting target user group to investigate the efficacy and design of
nudges.

<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.4.2    </span> <a 
 id="x106-32800010.4.2"></a>Framing the Goal Effectively</h4>
<!--l. 272--><p class="noindent" >Although the decoy effect did not prevail, we observed that participants who were suggested a
single passphrase as an alternative to their own passwords ended up creating longer and stronger
passwords – even if they rejected the suggestion. Thus, <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">H1 is supported</span>. What makes this finding
particularly interesting is the fact that a mangled password failed to produce a notable impact on
password strength.
</p><!--l. 275--><p class="noindent" >This is a potential consequence of latent mental models. As we have seen in Chapter <a 
href="dissch5.html#x74-1230005">5<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:pasdjo --></a>, users have a
rather robust mental model of a strong password. There is much evidence that users see the addition
of digits and symbols as highly advantageous for password strength. In this study, the mangled
password, however, did not receive the <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">best </span>strength rating but was only “second best”. The yellow
color of the strength meter might have added to the discouragement because it is not on the
positively connoted “green” spectrum. This might have already influenced participants’ mental
model about mangling strategies, so they proceeded with what they intended to pick in the first
place. On the contrary, the passphrase <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">did </span>receive the best rating and its strength bar was
colored green. Thus, the group who saw only this type of suggestion might have realized
that it is <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">easy to achieve </span>the highest rating simply by making passwords longer, or that
it is possible even without digits and symbols. Put simply, the passphrase seemed to
encourage participants to “go higher” because the goal was within reach. <span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Goal gradient</span>
<span 
class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">effects</span>, as discussed in Section <a 
href="dissch3.html#x53-1070003.4.1">3.4.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:rw:persuasion-psycho-background --></a>, support this argument. Putting both suggestions
side-by-side obviously negated these effects. The cognitive load might just be too high in that
case.

</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">10.4.3    </span> <a 
 id="x106-32900010.4.3"></a>Application Areas and Prospective Designs</h4>
<!--l. 282--><p class="noindent" >Participants in our study indicated that their preferred way to handle passwords is memorization,
echoing many other larger studies, e.g. <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XCSID2012PasswordHabits">64</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XOlmstead2017AmerciansCybersecurity">247</a>]</span>. Thus, users cannot be expected to create a unique
strong password for every account. Using a persuasive suggestion is thus only reasonable in a
limited number of situations. For instance, users often categorize passwords by their importance
(see Chapter <a 
href="dissch8.html#x98-2470008">8<!--tex4ht:ref: chap:mental_models_pwm --></a>, <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XStobert2014PasswordLifeCycle">316</a>, <a 
href="dissli2.html#XWash2016UnderstandingPasswordChoices">363</a>]</span>). For <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">important accounts </span>they are willing to pick stronger passwords,
                                                                                    

                                                                                    
so providing a good alternative like in our study could proof helpful. To make the strength
benefits even more graspable, the service could reward complying behavior with longer
expiration intervals (in case there are sufficient reasons to use such measures). For instance, a
suggestion can illustrate that stronger passwords do not expire (see Figure <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">??</span>). We put this
idea forward in <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XSeitz2016SuggestionsDecoy">291</a>]</span> and it was very recently evaluated by Renaud and Zimmermann
in a longitudinal study <span class="cite">[<a 
href="dissli2.html#XRenaud2018NudgingFolks">266</a>]</span>. Their findings conclusively show that <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">making benefits</span>
<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">graspable </span>is the primary key to effectively nudge users towards stronger passwords.
A special application area for graspable benefits is password managers. Users easily
recognize that a <span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">master password </span>for password managers need to meet higher strength
standards because it constitutes a single point of failure in protecting many accounts.
The benefit is therefore graspable and can be made salient very easily. Thus, creating a
master password is an opportune moment in which users are probably more receptive to
recommendations.

 id="x106-33000010.5"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<!--l. 296--><p class="noindent" >We set out to nudge users towards a password that is stronger than the first choice from
their “comfort zone”. From theories in behavioral economics, we carefully derived a
choice architecture that translates marketing strategies to “password advertisement”.
This direct translation, however, did not produce the envisioned decoy effects in our
online study with 83 participants. Instead, we found that encouraging people through an
easily achievable goal fostered a positive outcome: If participants saw that a passphrase
containing no digits and symbols could be “very strong” they managed to create stronger
passwords on average. We conclude that simplifying the sub-task to compare one’s own
performance to a suggested alternative is a key to successfully nudging users in this
direction. To avoid that such nudges wear off over time, they should only be used in
situations where the benefit of choosing a stronger password is graspable and evident to
users.
</p><!--l. 301--><p class="noindent" >Although the decoy effect did not show, this does not mean it does not exist for passwords. It could
simply mean that the direct adaptation of choice architectures in other fields is insufficient and
needs more fine-tuning. In a different UI design, where the dimensions are more clearly framed for
the users, the hypothesized preferential shift might be induced. A possible direction towards this is
to refrain from generating completely new passwords and instead nudge users towards a modified
version that significantly increases strength. Ur et al. have already provided first positive
results about suggesting password alterations. It would be interesting to find out if an
additional alteration that is “unattractive by design” could boost adoption rates of the target
suggestion. We see many opportunities to further explore persuasive password suggestions,
especially if they remove usability pain points of trying to create a memorable yet strong
